                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Coworker 2:</strong> It is time for part two of the children&rsquo;s show!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Coworker 1:</strong> It&rsquo;s time! It&rsquo;s time! I can&rsquo;t wait!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Coworker 3:</strong> Shh! I can&rsquo;t hear it!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Announcer:</strong> Last time on "The Time Traveling Treehouse," Anna was lost, really lost. She wants to learn about baseball. But her computer, MINDY, sent her to many wrong places.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> MINDY! Help me! I am in the ocean with a shark!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>MINDY:</strong> I will try one more time, Anna.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Please try&nbsp;<strong>harder,</strong>&nbsp;MINDY!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Now, where am I? I am at a playground with a baseball field! Yes! I can teach children about baseball here! MINDY, MINDY, it took you a long time. But you did it!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>MINDY:</strong> Thanks, Anna. Give me a call when you find the answer.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Okay. Come with me. Let&rsquo;s learn how to play baseball! This is a baseball&nbsp;<strong>field</strong>. This is a pitcher's&nbsp;<strong>mound</strong>. This is first&nbsp;<strong>base</strong>! This is second base! This is third base! This is home plate!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> To play baseball, you really only need a bat, a ball and a glove. Each team has many players.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Pitchers pitch the ball.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Catchers catch the ball.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Batters bat the ball.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Runners run the bases.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Fielders field the ball.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> First, the pitcher pitches the ball to the batter. The batter bats the ball. Then, the runner runs to first base.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Each time a batter bats, the runners run around the bases. Each time a runner runs across home plate, they score a run! There are nine innings in a game. The team with the most runs at the end of nine innings wins the game!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> MINDY, MINDY, we found the answer! It&rsquo;s time to return to the treehouse.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>MINDY:</strong> Good job! That was fast.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Coworker 3:</strong> Good job Anna. You know, I still don't like children's shows, but I like this children's show.<br /><strong>Coworker 2:</strong> I liked the time travel.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Coworker 1:</strong> But time travel is not real. You&rsquo;re so silly, Anna.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Yeah, time travel is so silly. Thanks, goodbye. Bye, thank you.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Hello, MINDY? Are you there?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>MINDY:</strong> Hello, Anna.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> MINDY, I want to go to China! Until next time &hellip;</p>
