                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Yes, MINDY, but it cannot teach us about baseball! And I don&rsquo;t know how to ski!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>MINDY:</strong> Sorry, Anna. Let&rsquo;s try again.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Where I am now!? MINDY, I am in the ocean! An ocean cannot teach us about baseball!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>MINDY:</strong> Please don&rsquo;t yell, Anna. The ocean can teach us about surfing.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Yes, MINDY, it can teach us about&nbsp;<strong>surfing</strong>&nbsp;&hellip; and&nbsp;<strong>sharks!&nbsp;</strong>Ahhh!</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> MINDY, please fix it faster. And get me out of here &hellip; now!</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Coworker 2:</strong> Will Anna find the answer?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Coworker 3:</strong> Please tell me the ending!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> So, you liked it?</p>
