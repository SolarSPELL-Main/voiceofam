                            or <strong>fall</strong>. My favorite season is summer because of <strong>summer vacation</strong>! Hey, that will
                            be a great <strong>subject</strong> for my new work assignment -- the children’s show. I can teach
                            what families in the U.S. do during summer vacation.Today, I’m <strong>planning</strong> the
                            show with Amelia. This is the first time we are working together. I hope we can
                            work well together. Hi, Amelia!</p>
