                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Hi there! Summer in Washington, D.C. is hot and sunny. I always ride the Metro to work. Riding the Metro is cool and fast. But today it’s closed. So, I am walking to work.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">(On the phone) Ms. Weaver, I am late this morning. The Metro is <strong>closed</strong>. So, I am walking to work.</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Caty: </strong>When you <strong>arrive</strong>, please come to my office. I have important news to tell you.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Of course. Good-bye. My boss has news for me. The question is: Is it good news or bad news?</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>The good news. No … okay, the bad news.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Caty: </strong>The bad news is you are not good at reading the news.</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Next month is <strong>July</strong>. You are <strong>firing</strong> me in July.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Caty: </strong> No. I am not firing you in July … or in <strong>August</strong> or in <strong>September</strong>. That is the good news.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Okay. You are not firing me. I am not reading the news. What <em>will</em> I be doing?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Caty: </strong>Well, you are good at asking questions. You are good at talking to people. You are good at showing your feelings. And you are great at being <strong>silly</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Thank you, Ms. Weaver. But what does all that <strong>mean</strong>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Caty: </strong>I have a new <strong>assignment</strong> for you! Your <strong>skills</strong> are <strong>perfect</strong> for a new show … a children’s show.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>A children’s show ... That is awesome! When do I start?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Caty: </strong>You start next month. Start thinking of <strong>ideas</strong> for the show.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I <u>have</u> <strong>tons</strong> of <strong>ideas</strong>! I can show children what it’s like in <strong>outer space</strong> ...</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Caty: </strong>Great …</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>… or in the <strong>deep</strong>, dark <strong>ocean</strong> …</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Caty: </strong>Those are great ideas, Anna. Please go think of more … at your desk.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Yes. What <strong>other</strong> things can I show them? <strong>Mt. Everest! Everyone</strong> has different skills. You have skills. I have skills. The important thing is to know what you are good at. Until next time!</p>

                        <h2>Learning Strategy</h2>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Learning Strategies are the thoughts and actions that help make learning easier or
                            more effective.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">The learning strategy for this lesson is <em>Summarize</em>. In this week's video, you hear
                            Ms. Weaver tell Anna, "Well, you are good at asking questions. You are good at
                            talking to people. You are good at showing your feelings. And you are great at
                            being silly." Anna does not understand why Ms. Weaver is telling her about her
                            skills. She asks, "But what does all that mean?"</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">In answering the question, Ms. Weaver <em>summarizes</em>, "I have a new assignment for
                            you! Your skills are perfect for a new show … a children’s show." When we
                            <em>summarize</em> we tell a story or report on information in fewer words. We tell the
                            most important information and do not include many details. <em>Summarizing</em> helps us
                            remember new information and practice using new words.</p>
