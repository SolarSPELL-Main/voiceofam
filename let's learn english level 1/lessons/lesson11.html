The learning strategy for this lesson is Ask Questions. When we are learning a language, asking questions helps us practice and get new information. Here is an example.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>Tatiana is visiting her friend in New York. Her friend goes to work one day and gives Tatiana a map of the city. Tatiana wants to run in Central Park. She walks out of the apartment and sees a woman with two children. Tatiana thinks, "I need help with the map. I do not know where this apartment is on the map." She asks the woman, "Excuse me. Is Central Park near here?" The woman smiles and says, "Yes, walk to the bus station and turn left. It's not far away." Tatiana asks, "Thank you. Can you show me where we are on the map?" The woman shows Tatiana her friend's street on the map. "Have a nice day!" she says as she walks away. Tatiana is happy she can ask questions in English. She soon finds the park and has a great run.</em></p>
