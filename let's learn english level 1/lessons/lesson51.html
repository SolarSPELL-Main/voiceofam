                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>D.C. is a popular city for <strong>marathons</strong>! A marathon is a long race. Many marathons raise money for charity, you know - good works. A marathon is a good <strong>fitness</strong> goal too. I want to challenge myself in a marathon and maybe win a medal! Hey, there’s Ashley. Ashley! Wait for me! It’s Anna!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Ash … ley. Ash … ley.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley: </strong>Are you okay, Anna?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I just ran … from over there.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley: </strong>Do you want to sit down, Anna? Do you want some water? (Anna takes the bottle and tries to return it.) No thanks. You keep it.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Thanks. I didn’t know you like to run.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley: </strong>I love running. In fact, this weekend, I will run in my first marathon.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Me … too.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley: </strong>Really? You are running in a marathon?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Yeah. In a couple of days. Why do you ask … like that?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley: </strong>What do you know about running in a marathon?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I know that there’s a lot of running and sometimes you can win a medal.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley: </strong>How long have you been <strong>training</strong>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I started today. I’ve been training for an hour … no, an hour and seven minutes!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley: </strong>Anna, training a little every day is a good habit to get into. Not all at once!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Thanks for the advice, Ashley. But I’m running in a <strong>special</strong> race.</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I don’t remember the name. But the website said everyone gets a medal.</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Thanks, Ashley. Good luck to you, too.</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>What? How am I going to meet my goal?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Woman: </strong>Ma’am, this race is for children. You can’t run with the children.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Children? Children. That’s perfect. I just might win!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Woman: </strong>No, ma’am. You really can’t run with the children.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I’m sorry. Of course. I was only thinking of my goal.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Woman: </strong>Well, you can help us with our goal, which is to raise money for sick children. Would you like to help us?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I’ve just found my new goal. And I get to wear a medal. (to child who finished race) Good job!</p>
