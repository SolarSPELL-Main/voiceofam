                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Happy New Year! Some people, at the start of a new year, make a <strong>resolution</strong> -- a promise to yourself to be better. I thought about my resolution carefully. I want to be an actor on the stage! Today I will <strong>audition</strong> for a show called "The Woods Are Alive!" Wish me luck!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Director: </strong>Next! What is your name?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>My name is Anna Matteo.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Director: </strong>Are you ready to audition?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>(warms up voice) Yes.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Director: </strong>Great. Let's begin on page 1. Here is the story. You are lost in the woods. You are searching <strong>desperately</strong> for a way out. <strong>Suddenly</strong>, you hear something.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Director: </strong>Now, say your line.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>'What was that? Hello. Is someone there?'</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Director: </strong>Anna, you are speaking too <strong>softly</strong>. Can you speak more <strong>loudly</strong> and a little more, um, seriously?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Yes, of course I can. 'What was that? Hello. Is someone there?' Is that loud <strong>enough</strong>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Director: </strong>Yes, that is loud enough. Let's turn to page 25. In this scene, you are moving <strong>slowly</strong> and <strong>quietly</strong>  through the woods.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Director: </strong>Anna. Anna! You are walking quickly and <strong>loudly</strong>. Walk slowly and quietly.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I'm walking slowly and quietly. I am walking...</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Director: </strong>Anna. Anna. You don't need to say "slowly" and "quietly." Alright, let's try the last scene. Turn to page 48. I say my <strong>line</strong> first, then you say your line.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Director: </strong>'You will never get out of these woods alive! <em>Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!'</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>'Yes, I will.'</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Director: </strong>Okay, Anna, you said that line --you said that line really late. You need to say it earlier.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Sorry. Sorry. Let me try again.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Director: </strong> 'You will never ...'</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>'Yes, I will.'</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Director: </strong> '... get out of the woods alive.'</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I was too early, wasn't I?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Director: </strong> Yes. Yes, you were.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Director, how am I doing?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Director: </strong> You know, Anna. I think that I have the perfect part for you.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Director: </strong>The costume is in the back. Please go try it on.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Awesome! (Anna returns as a tree.)</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Director: </strong>Oh, Anna, that fits you perfectly!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I'm a tree. I'm a tree in ... "The Woods Are Alive!" Yes!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>My new year is starting awesomely! Excuse me, Director! I have a great idea for my tree. Oh, wait! Until next time!</p>

The director tells her that she said her line too late. Later, Anna notices a problem: "I was too early, wasn’t I?' She is self-evaluating. This strategy can help to make her a better actor.</P>
