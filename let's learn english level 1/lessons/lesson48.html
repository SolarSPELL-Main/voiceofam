                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Hello! I have lived in Washington, D.C. for a long time now. And I have done a lot. I feel that I know this city pretty well. (walks off and comes back) That's the wrong way. Where is it again?</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>(sees a tourist at a sign) Excuse me, can I help you? Have we met before?</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Jean: </strong>I don’t think so. I’ve just flown in from Boston. My name is Jean.</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Hi, Jean! I'm Anna. I really feel like we’ve met before. Anyway, how can I help?</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Jean: </strong>I want to see an interesting museum but I don’t know which one.</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I can help with that. I’ve lived in Washington, D.C. a long time. I think I’ve seen all the museums.</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Jean: </strong>Wow, thanks. So, tell me, which museums are good?</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Well, they are all good. But they’re all different. There are <strong>science</strong> museums and history museums and art and culture museums.</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Jean: </strong>I want to see an unusual museum.</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I like the <strong>Sculpture</strong> Garden. Have you ever seen sculptures in a garden? It is really artistic!</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Jean: </strong>I have never seen a garden of sculptures! I’ll write that on my list!</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Have you been to the Museum of the <strong>American Indian</strong>? I’ve visited that museum many times. It is very peaceful.</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Jean: </strong>I have always liked American Indian culture.</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Jean: </strong>I’ll put that on my list. (writes on list) Do you have any other <strong>suggestions</strong>?</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Well, if you like <strong>plants</strong>, you can visit the <strong>U.S. Botanic Gardens</strong>. It's very organic.</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Jean: </strong>I have always loved plants. I’ll write that on my list, too! Wow, you know so much about D.C.’s museums.</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Well, I have lived here for over a year.</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Jean: </strong>You’re so lucky to live in such a beautiful city filled with so many museums and a zoo!</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>What? D.C. has a zoo?</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Jean: </strong>Yes, and it’s beautiful. You’ve lived here for so long and you haven’t been to the zoo?</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I've never been to D.C.’s zoo. I've never been to any zoos!</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Jean: </strong>You have never seen zoo animals?</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I grew up on a farm, Jean. I've known farm animals my whole life.</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Jean: </strong>But the zoo has <strong>lions</strong> (makes sound of lion roaring) and <strong>elephants</strong> (makes sound of elephant trumpeting) and <strong>zebras</strong> (makes no sound)! If you have never seen a real, live elephant, you must. They are so <strong>majestic</strong>.</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I will. I will! (writes list) There. I’ve written my own must-see zoo animal list!</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Jean: </strong>Have fun at the zoo and thanks, Anna!</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Have fun at the museums, Jean! And thank YOU!</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>This has been awesome! And I have seen every animal on my list! Jean, the tourist, helped me see more of my city. But where have I seen her before?</p>
				        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Oh well. Until next time …</p>
