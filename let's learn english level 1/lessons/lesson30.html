                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Hello! Washington, D.C. sits on the <strong>Potomac River</strong>. This river is important to the history and culture of the city. Today, I am at an outdoor <strong>seafood market</strong> near the Potomac River. Some say it is the <strong>oldest</strong> outdoor seafood market in the United States! I am here to buy seafood. Let’s see what they have!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Excuse me. Can you help me?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Sure! What do you need?<strong></strong><P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Pete!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Anna!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> What are you doing here?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> I work here. You know, it’s not easy to be a writer.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Yeah, I heard that. Sorry.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> But this job is great. I work outside by the river. And I can eat all the free
                            seafood I want!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> That is great, Pete. In fact, I am here to buy <strong>some</strong> seafood for my dinner
                            party.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> You came to the right place. They have the <strong>freshest</strong> seafood in town. <strong>How
                            much money</strong> can you <strong>spend</strong>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> I can only spend $50.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Okay. What do you want?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> First, I want to buy some shrimp.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Sure thing. Follow me. How much shrimp do you want?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> How much do I need for five people?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> (yells to co-worker) Give her a <strong>pound</strong> of shrimp!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Ok, now I want to buy some <strong>crabs</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> The crabs here are delicious! They are the <strong>best</strong> because they come from the
                            nearby <strong>Chesapeake Bay</strong>! Walk this way.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> How <strong>many</strong> crabs do you want?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> I want a <strong>dozen</strong> crabs.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> You should get the <strong>larger</strong> crabs. They have the <strong>most</strong> meat.</p><strong></strong>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Then I want a dozen large crabs, please!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Is that everything you need?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Let’s see … I have shrimp and crabs. And a friend is bringing a <strong>salad</strong> and
                            many <strong>ears</strong> of <strong>corn-on-the-cob</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Is that all the seafood that you need?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Yes.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> That’ll be $49.95. Cash or <strong>credit</strong>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Credit, please.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Anna, you love to eat seafood. Did you grow up on the water?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> No, I didn’t. But I love the water. And I love being on the water.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> You know how to sail?</p><strong></strong>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Well … this afternoon I am going on a boat.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> You are full of surprises. What kind of boat? Is it a <strong>motorboat</strong> or a <strong>sailboat</strong>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> It’s a special boat, Pete. Well, thanks for your help. See you later!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> See you, Anna! Wow, Anna’s a <strong>sailor</strong>! Who knew?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Yes, rivers are important to the history and culture of Washington, D.C. And
                            now I am part of this city’s interesting <strong>waterfront</strong> culture. Until next time!</p>

                        <h2>Learning Strategy</h2>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Learning Strategies</strong> are the thoughts and actions that help make learning easier or more effective. The learning strategy for this lesson is <em>Make Inferences . Making inferences</em> means using some information to make a guess. When learning a new language, we often need to guess at the meanings of words or sentences.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">In this week's video, Pete guesses that Anna grew up on the water. He says, "Anna, you love to eat seafood. Did you grow on near the water?" </p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Anna answers, "No, I didn’t. But I love the <strong>water</strong>. And I love being <em>on</em> the water."Pete hears that and uses the information to <em>make an inference</em> about Anna. He asks her, "You know how to <strong>sail</strong>?"</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Can you find another place in the conversation when Pete makes an inference?</strong> Do you ever <em>make inferences</em> when listening to or reading English?</p>
