                            easier or more effective.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">The learning strategy for this lesson is <em>Predict</em>. When we <em>predict</em>, we are
                            using what we know to say what will happen in the future. In using English,
                            it is helpful if you can <em>predict</em> what is coming up in a story that you are
                            reading or something that you are listening to. This helps your brain
                            prepare to understand the next part of the story.</p>

                            She <em>predicts</em> that they will be busy on their trip back to Washington, D.C.</p>
