                        <h2>Learning Strategy</h2>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Learning Strategies</strong> are the thoughts and actions that help make learning
                            easier or more effective. <em>Plan to Learn</em> is an important learning strategy
                            because it helps you arrange your best learning conditions. You organize the
                            resources and tools you need to study well. Here is an example of how to use
                            this strategy.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>Oluchi knows she needs to have a quiet place to study. She takes her English
                            homework to a quiet corner of her home, and turns off her phone and radio.
                            She brings a cup of coffee to help her stay awake. She makes sure her
                            dictionary is near and that she has pencils and paper to write notes. When
                            she begins studying, everything she needs is in easy reach. Her full attention
                            can focus on what she wants to learn.</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">How about you? What conditions help you to study better? Some people like a
                            little background noise, like in a cafe. Others need a very quiet place. Do you
                            have a favorite chair or place in your home where you study well? Do you work
                            better when you study with a friend or in a small group?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Teachers, see the&nbsp;<a href="../../content/let's learn english/Lesson 05_ Where Are You_/Lesson 05 Teaching Resources/Lesson 05 Teacher's Lesson Plan.pdf">Lesson Plan&nbsp;</a>for more details on teaching this strategy.</p>
