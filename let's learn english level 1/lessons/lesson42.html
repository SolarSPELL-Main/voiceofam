                            Washington, D.C. at the scene of a <strong>crime</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Guy:</strong> We are talking with this woman.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Guy:</strong> She saw the crime during her lunch break. It looks like she hurt
                            <strong>herself</strong> while she was trying to stop the crime.</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Hi, Guy. I'm Anna.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Guy:</strong> Anna, what did you see and what happened to your <strong>arm</strong>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Guy, I was <strong>minding</strong> my <strong>own business</strong>. See, I work over there.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Guy:</strong> Um-hum.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> I left work to get some lunch. Then suddenly, I heard a woman
                            yelling. She was yelling like this ... “Help! Help!”</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Guy:</strong> Um-hum.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Two <strong>robbers</strong> were <strong>grabbing</strong> her bag like this. She was hitting them
                            with her <strong>umbrella</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Guy:</strong> Is that when you hurt your arm?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> No. At that time, I was not fighting the robbers.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Guy:</strong> Um-hum.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> See. I was too far away and I didn't have my own umbrella.</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> They grabbed her bag and ran away! So, I grabbed her umbrella and
                            ran after the robbers.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Guy:</strong> Then that is the time that you hurt your arm?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> No. I was yelling, “Stop, robbers! Stop!” She was yelling, “Hey, come
                            back with my umbrella!”</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Guy:</strong> Were you afraid?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> I had no time to be afraid, Guy. Well, I had time while I was resting
                            on a bench. I had a lot of time.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Guy:</strong> Then what happened?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> The robbers got on a bus. So, I ran after the bus. While I was running, I <strong>tripped</strong> and <strong>fell</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Guy:</strong> And that is the time that you hurt your arm?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> No. While I was <strong>lying</strong> on the <strong>ground</strong>, someone <strong>stepped</strong> on my arm!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Guy:</strong> Ouch. That’s too bad.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Yeah. And they didn’t apologize. Well, then the robbers got
                            themselves kicked off the bus.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Guy:</strong> Why?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> They didn’t pay. You've got to pay when you get on a bus. The
                            police came and took them away.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Guy:</strong> And <em>that’s</em> when you hurt your arm!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> No.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Guy:</strong> Then, when did you hurt <strong>yourself</strong>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Well, Guy, by this time, I was feeling very hungry. So, I went to my
                            office to get a <strong>snack</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>C:</strong> Anna, I'm calling for help right now.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>C:</strong> (<em>on the phone</em>) Hello? Yes, please come right away. My co-worker is
                            <strong>stuck</strong> in a <strong>vending machine</strong>.</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Learning Strategies</strong> are the thoughts and actions that help make learning easier or more effective.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">The learning strategy for this lesson is Use Selective Attention. When you are listening in English, sometimes we can't understand every word. At those times, you can listen for the important words and try your best to understand.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">In this lesson, Anna tries to understand Ms. Weaver. Ms. Weaver wants Anna to get a bigger audience. But Anna pays attention to the cats in the posters that Ms. Weaver shows her. She thinks Ms. Weaver wants to see more cats in The Time Traveling Treehouse.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">When you use <em>selective attention</em>, you may not always understand perfectly. But you can always ask a question to check on your understanding. Anna did not ask to make sure of what Ms. Weaver wanted. In real life, you should check your understanding when you use selective attention.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Do you ever use selective attention? Do you think Anna made a mistake when she used selective attention in this lesson? Teachers, see the&nbsp;<a href="../../content/let's learn english/Lesson 42_I Was Minding My Own Business/Lesson 42 Teaching Resources/Lesson 42 Lesson Plan.pdf">Lesson Plan&nbsp;</a>for more details on teaching this strategy.</p>
