                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Learning Strategies are the thoughts and actions that help make learning easier or more effective. The learning strategy for this lesson is <em>Use Images</em>. When we listen to directions, it helps to use an image in our mind or on a screen or paper to understand them better. Here is an example.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>Marcos wants to go to his friend Lucia's house. He asks her to give him directions. As he listens, he draws a map on a piece of paper. Lucia says, "Turn right at the supermarket." Marcos draws a box with an 'S' on his map. He draws an arrow (=>) to the right. When he is walking to Lucia's house, he thinks of the map. He remembers the supermarket and the arrow. He turns right and finds Lucia's house.</em></p>
