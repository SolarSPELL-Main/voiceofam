                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Hello! I have great news. My best friend from my hometown is coming here -- to Washington, D.C.! I can’t wait to catch up with her! Oh! I gotta go. Her <strong>train</strong> arrives in 10 minutes!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Penelope!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>Anna! I am really happy to see you!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Me too! How was your trip?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>It was fine.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Yes, that's mine. These are all my travel things. Thank you, thank you!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Let me help you with your bags.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>I’m really excited to be in Washington, D.C.! I can’t wait to hear about ... everything!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I have so much to tell you. Let’s go to my apartment. We can talk over a hot cup of <strong>tea</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>I love your apartment building, Anna. Is your <strong>rent</strong> expensive?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Well, I have a roommate. So, we split the rent.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>Oh, that’s right. Is your roommate nice?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Marsha is the nicest person I know in this city. Sometimes she worries too much. And she says I’m the messiest cook she knows. But we are great roommates.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>So, Anna, is it hard to make friends in D.C.?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>At first it was hard. But now, Marsha is a good friend. And there’s Pete. Of all the people I know in D.C., Pete is the most serious and also the <strong>silliest</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>He sounds ... interesting.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Jonathan and Ashley are two other good friends of mine. In the city, they are the <strong>friendliest</strong> people I know. They always help me when I need it.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>Your friends sound great! So, tell me about your job.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I love my work! I make a children’s show called the “Time Traveling Treehouse.”</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>Anna, that is the best job for you! Do you remember when we were little? We played in that old treehouse behind my family’s house for hours!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I forgot about that! We thought it really time traveled! Penelope, it is really good to talk to you. New friends are good. But old friends are the best.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>I know. Our hometown isn’t the same now. You are not there.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>No <strong>crying</strong>. Why don't you move here and live with me and Marsha?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>Anna, I can’t leave our hometown. You forget -- I love my job, too.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I didn’t forget. You are the most famous turkey farmer I know!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>Thanks, Anna.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Come on. Let’s go eat dinner at one of D.C.’s most famous restaurants.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>Awesome!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>That’s the restaurant, Penelope. I’ll be right there.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I have a great apartment. I love my work. And I have awesome friends -- both old and new. I am the luckiest woman in Washington, D.C. (sound of thunder).</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Until next time?</p>
