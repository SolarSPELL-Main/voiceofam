                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Dr. Bennett:</strong> Excuse me, Anna. But I don’t need to know all that. Do you have a <strong>fever</strong>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Oh. My thermometer says 125 degrees?! What??</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Dr. Bennett:</strong> Yeah, that’s not right.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Oh. Wait. The thermometer was in my hot cup of coffee.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Dr. Bennett:</strong> Please take it again, Anna.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Okay, the thermometer says 100.5 degrees.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Dr. Bennett:</strong> 100.5 degrees is not too high. I want you to drink lots of water. Rest in bed and get lots of sleep.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> That is what my boss <strong>said</strong> to do. Um, Dr. Bennett, when can I go to work?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Dr. Bennett:</strong> Don’t go to work for a couple of days.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Yes! I mean, I don’t want to make my co-workers sick.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Dr. Bennett:</strong> That’s right. Call me back in a couple of days.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> I will, Dr. Bennett. And thanks.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Well, you <strong>heard</strong> the doctor – no work for a couple of days. I need water, sleep and um ... lots of movies! Well, the doctor didn’t say anything about movies. But it can’t <strong>hurt</strong>! Until next time!</p>
