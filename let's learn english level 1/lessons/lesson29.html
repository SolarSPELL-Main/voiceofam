                            But people who live here often do not have time to see them. They are too busy
                            with work -- like me. Hi, Marsha!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Marsha:</strong>  Hi, Anna! Have a seat.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong>  Thanks. This was a good idea. Working outdoors is nice.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Marsha:</strong>  <strong>Um-hum</strong>, it is.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong>  I am <strong>tired</strong>. Today was a busy day at work. And I still have work to do!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Marsha:</strong>  Hmm, that’s too bad.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong>  How are you these days?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Marsha: </strong> I'm really busy too, Anna. Let’s get to work.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> Marsha, look! That bus has a photo of Abraham Lincoln!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Marsha: </strong> That’s an <strong>advertisement</strong> for Ford’s Theatre. They have a new show.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong>  They have shows where Abraham Lincoln <strong>died</strong>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Marsha:</strong>  Yeah, it’s a <strong>working</strong> theater and a museum.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> I love Lincoln. You know, Marsha, that advertisement reminds me of something.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Marsha:</strong>  Um-hum. What’s that?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong>  When I was a little girl … When I was a little girl … I was not like other children.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Marsha:</strong>  Um-hum, I can <strong>believe</strong> that.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna's voice:</strong>  I was tall, serious child. At the playground the other children played
                            silly games. They played with dart guns. They played on the swings, the slide and the teeter-totter. They also played ball But not me. I loved to read serious books about U.S. presidents.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong>  In fact, I wanted to be … don’t laugh … President of the United States.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Marsha:</strong>  (laughs)</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong>  Stop! I know it’s a silly childhood dream.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Marsha:</strong>  I’m sorry. It’s not silly. Guess what I wanted to be?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong>  What?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Marsha:</strong>  I wanted to be... an <strong>astronaut</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong>  Really?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Marsha's Voice:</strong>  When I was a kid, I studied the <strong>stars</strong> and <strong>planets</strong>. I wanted to fly into outer space!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong>  You know, Marsha, childhood dreams are really important.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Marsha:</strong>  They are. And it’s good to remember them.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong>  Hey! I have an idea. Let’s go.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Marsha:</strong> Go where?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong>  Let’s go make our childhood <strong>dreams</strong> come true.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Marsha:</strong>  We’re going to the Air & Space Museum! Yes!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong>  No. We’re going to see a show at Ford’s Theatre just like Abraham Lincoln! It’s not far from here.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Marsha: </strong> Uh huh. That is your childhood dream.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong>  Good point. Okay, next week, we'll come here and be astronauts.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Marsha:</strong>  Honestly?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong>  Honestly.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong>  Tonight we are seeing a show at Ford’s Theatre, where a man <strong>shot</strong> President
                             Abraham Lincoln. This is history come to life … and a childhood dream come <strong>true</strong>! Until next time ...</p>

The learning strategy for this lesson is <em>Personalize</em>. When we connect new information to our own interests and experiences, we are <em>personalizing</em>.  Personalizing can help us remember new information.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">In this week's video, Anna is learning about historic places in Washington, D.C.  The advertisement for Ford's Theatre makes her think of her childhood dream - to
                            be President of the United States. Anna is<em> personalizing</em> because she is connecting new information to her own interest in U.S. Presidents. She decides to act on her
                            interests by going to the theater and learning more about Abraham Lincoln's history.</p>
