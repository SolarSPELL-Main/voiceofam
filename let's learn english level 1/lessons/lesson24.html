                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Learning Strategies are the thoughts and actions that help make learning easier or
                            more effective.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">The learning strategy for this lesson is <em>Respond</em>. In many everyday situations, we
                            have to <em>respond</em> to what we hear. Speaking English as a second language might
                            make it hard for you to respond quickly. The strategy <em>respond</em> is part of listening
                            actively. After listening to what the other person says, you respond on the same
                            topic.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">In the video, Jonathan listens to the food truck worker. She says they are out of
                            shrimp. Jonathan <em>responds</em>. First, he repeats the sentence, "Oh, you're out of 
                            shrimp." That shows he understands. Second, he asks for a different dish. "I'll have
                            the beef, then."</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">When you talk with someone in English, how do you usually <em>respond</em>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Teachers, see the&nbsp;<a href="../../content/let's learn english/Lesson 24_Yesterday Was Amazing/Lesson 24 Teaching Resources/Lesson 24 Lesson Plan.pdf">Lesson Plan&nbsp;</a>for more details on teaching this strategy.</p>
