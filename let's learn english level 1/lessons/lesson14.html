Meilin looks at her English lesson. She sees a photo of a woman in black jeans. She says to her classmate, "I don't like black jeans. Do you?" Meilin is using the strategy "personalize" because she is speaking English to tell about herself and her own likes or dislikes. Tomorrow she will remember the words better, because she is thinking about herself when she says them. </em></p>
