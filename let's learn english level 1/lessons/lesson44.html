                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> I’m hungry. When I’m hungry, I only want to eat junk food! But I know
                            I should eat healthy food. So, I fight with myself. One side says, ‘You
                            should eat healthy food.’ The other side says, ‘But I want to eat junk food!’</p>

                            healthy foods. But, a little junk food will not kill me. Hmm, ice cream. Ice
                            cream does sound good.</p>
