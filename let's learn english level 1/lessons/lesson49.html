                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>Yeah, it’s for our new show -- “D.C. Secrets.”</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>You've got it, Agent Peacock. The mission is safe with me.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>Oh, okay, great. Just be back by noon.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Agent Peacock, I’m at an <strong>air duct</strong>!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>Yes, spies sometimes <strong>sneak</strong> down air ducts.</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>Umm … have you ever <strong>cracked</strong> a code?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>No.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>Well, go learn. Spies use their <strong>brains</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Got it! I’ve never cracked a code before. Let’s try, Agent Flamingo! This is really hard. I'm still trying to crack the code. I've cracked the code! I've cracked the code, Agent Peacock! My brain really hurts.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>Great. Umm, Agent Flamingo, now answer this question: Do spies have to be in good <strong>shape</strong>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>“Yes,” Agent Peacock! Spies have to be in really good shape! Can you hear me?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>You’re breaking up, Flamingo.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>The International Spy Museum is awesome! Agent Peacock, I <strong>completed</strong> the mission!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>Great. Great. Now, I have another very important mission for you.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Got it. See you back at <strong>H.Q.</strong>!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>Yummy! You brought my lunch! Thanks, Agent Flamingo!</p>
