                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> I know that, Anna. But there were too many spark plugs … in there.
                            So I took out the extra ones.</p>

                            15 minutes.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Where’re your <strong>tools</strong>?</p>

                            from a <strong>master</strong>.</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Great! But we need teamwork. You sit in the car. When I say “go,”
                            you start the engine.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Okay, go!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Stop!</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> It's not starting! It’s not starting!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> What’s wrong?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> This car is <strong>stupid</strong> … stupid, stupid!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Pete, kicking the <strong>tires</strong> will not help.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Well, you did not help, Anna. You did not help!!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Pete, Pete! Pull yourself together, man. Give me the <strong>keys</strong>. I must
                            feel the key in the <strong>ignition</strong> and turn it myself.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Master:</strong> Use the key, Anna. Turn the key, Anna. What are you forgetting,

                            go get some.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Pete. You relax. Clean your <strong>face</strong>. You can watch the rest of your
                            online video course. It’ll be faster if I go … in a flash. Until next time …</p>
