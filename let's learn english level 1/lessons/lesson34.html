                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">The learning strategy for this lesson is<em>&nbsp;</em><em>Make Your Best Guess</em><em>.</em>&nbsp;That<em>&nbsp;</em>means using what you know about the world to make a guess. When we do this with language, it can help us understand and speak more fluently.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">For example, Anna says she might be able to read minds. But she is really guessing. After she hears Rebecca say, "I'm a junior in college." Anna says, "You are thinking &hellip; you will graduate from college in about one year." She knows that "junior" means a student in the third year at a four-year college, so she can make a good guess that Rebecca will be graduating in one year.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Can you find another example in the lesson of Anna making a guess?&nbsp;</p>
