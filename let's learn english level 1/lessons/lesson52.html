                        <h2>Conversation</h2>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Hello, it's Anna! I did it - Washington, D.C. is my home. Looking back over the past year, I’ve done so many amazing things! I have met people from all over the world. I’ve made many good friends. And I have a great job! And I've taken a lot of chances. And now I have some really big news! Wait for it … and 3, 2, 1 …</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>Hello and welcome to “Around the Corner and Across the Street from the Actor’s Studio!” Many people dream of becoming actors. But very often, those dreams don’t come true.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>Well, today we will meet a woman and -- her acting <strong>career</strong> has really <strong>taken off</strong>. In fact, she acted in my play, “The Woods Are Alive!” Oh. She really brought the part of Tree Number 15 to life! Let’s give a warm welcome to Anna Matteo!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Thank you. Thank you so much for having me here.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>Please, please, sit down. Here, here, let me help you.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Thanks. Thanks. Wow, it is great to see you again, Director Kelly!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>It’s great to see you too, Anna. I see you are still wearing your tree costume. Does this have anything to do with your big news?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Yes. Yes, it does.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>Well, Anna, please <strong>share</strong> that news with us.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Kelly, I will be acting in three movies.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>That is amazing! Anna, tell us more.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Well, the first is a <strong>science fiction</strong> movie. The second is a <strong>romantic comedy</strong>. And the third is an <strong>action</strong> movie.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>That is so great! Let me guess -- you’re playing a tree in all of them!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Yes! This is what happened. To prepare for your play, I had to <strong>find out</strong> what it was like to BE a tree in the world. I had to find out where to eat, where to shop, where to meet people and how to <strong>get around</strong> the city.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>Amazing. I think big things are going to happen for you, Anna. So, tell me, will you be moving to Hollywood for a career in movies?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>No. I’ll make the movies and then <strong>come back</strong>. Washington, D.C. is my home.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>I’m sure your family is very <strong>proud</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Yes, they are. You know, Kelly, not too long ago, I didn’t feel very good about my life. I had to make a change. So, I took some <strong>chances</strong>. Sometimes I succeeded. Sometimes I <strong>failed</strong>. But I will never stop trying.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>Well, thank you for sharing your news and so much more with us, Anna.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>Until next time … </p>
