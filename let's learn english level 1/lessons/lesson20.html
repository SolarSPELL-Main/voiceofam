                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Hi, there! Washington, D.C. is a great place to work. Many people here
                            work in government and politics. But there are many other jobs. You can work at a
                        <strong>hospital</strong>; a <strong>university</strong>. You can work in a coffee shop. Wait a minute, I think I see
                            a friend of mine. Pete? Is that you?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Hi, Anna.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> You look different. Your beard … is really big.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> You don’t like it, do you?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> No, no. You just look … different.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">(To server) Thank you. So, what’s wrong? You look sad.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> I don’t have a job.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Sorry, I can’t hear you.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> I do not have a job!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Oh. I’m sorry to hear that, Pete.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> I don’t have a skill.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Everyone has a skill. You need to find yours.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> I don’t know, Anna.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Pete, I am good at asking questions. Let me ask you some.</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Yes, I can. Let me help.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Sure, Anna. Maybe you <em>can</em> help.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Can you write <strong>code</strong>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Sure, c-o-l-d. How is this going to help?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> No, not “cold.” <strong>Code</strong>; you know, for making <strong>phone apps</strong>, or <strong>websites</strong>. You
                            can make tons of money writing code.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Tons of money? But I can’t <strong>code</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Next question. Can you drive?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Do you mean drive a race car? It’s really <strong>hard</strong> to be a race car driver. First,
                            you need a race car ...</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> No, I mean drive a taxi or drive a bus.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> No, I always fall asleep when I drive.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Oh, that’s not good. Next question. Can you teach? You can be a <strong>teacher</strong> in
                            a <strong>school</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> No, I cannot teach.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Can you cook? You can be a <strong>chef</strong> in a restaurant.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> No, I can’t code! I can’t teach! I can’t cook! Anna, I can’t do anything. This
                            is sad. I’m gonna write about my feelings in my <strong>blog</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> You write a blog?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Yeah, I write a blog.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> How many <strong>followers</strong> do you have?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> I don’t know … 59,538.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Pete, that's a lot of followers! You can make money writing!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Writing is <strong>easy</strong>. Everyone can write.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Not everyone can write <strong>well</strong>. You can be a writer!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> I can be a writer. I can be a writer! I can be a writer! Thanks, Anna.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Marsha:</strong> Hi, Pete. Hi, Anna.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Hi, Marsha. Excuse me, I have to go.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Marsha:</strong> Where are you going?</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">(To Anna) He does know that it’s not easy to be a writer, doesn’t he?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> There are many different jobs you can have in Washington, D.C. Pete wants
                            to be a writer. I wish him luck. Lots of luck. Until next time!</p>

                            someone in English it helps to <em>identify problems</em> in understanding and get the
                            information we need to correct the problems.</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">1. Anna identifies one problem. Pete is not talking loud enough. She tells Pete.
                            "Sorry, I can’t hear you." Pete speaks more loudly so she can hear him.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">2. Later, Pete does not understand Anna. He asks, "<u>Do you mean</u> drive a race car?"
                            Anna explains that she means to "drive a taxi or drive a bus."</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Can you find another time in the video when Anna or Pete identifies a
                            problem?</strong></p>
