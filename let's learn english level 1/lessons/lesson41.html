                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">The learning strategy for this lesson is Use Selective Attention. When you are listening in English, sometimes we can't understand every word. At those times, you can listen for the important words and try your best to understand.</P>

But Anna pays attention to the cats in the posters that Ms. Weaver shows her. She thinks Ms. Weaver wants to see more cats in The Time Traveling Treehouse.</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">When you use <em>selective attention</em>, you may not always understand perfectly. But you can always ask a question to check on your understanding. Anna did not ask to make sure of what Ms. Weaver wanted. In real life, you should check your understanding when you use selective attention.</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Do you ever use selective attention? Do you think Anna made a mistake when she used selective attention in this lesson?
