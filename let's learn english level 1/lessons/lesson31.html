                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Hi, there, sports fans!&nbsp;<strong>Baseball</strong>&nbsp;is America&rsquo;s sport. Today, I am going to&nbsp;<strong>Nationals Park</strong>. It is home to Washington, D.C.&rsquo;s baseball<strong>&nbsp;team</strong>&nbsp;-- the Washington Nationals!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Hi, Jonathan!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Jonathan:</strong> Hi, Anna! Where are you going?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> I am taking a bus to a Nationals baseball game!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Jonathan:</strong> Don&rsquo;t take the bus. A&nbsp;<u>taxi is&nbsp;<strong>faster</strong>&nbsp;<strong>than</strong>&nbsp;a bus</u>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Oh, good idea. You know I love baseball.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Jonathan:</strong> That&rsquo;s great. Have fun.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> In fact, I wanted to be a baseball player.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Jonathan:</strong> Is this one of your memories? I&rsquo;m really busy.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> This won&rsquo;t take long. I can see it now... I am at&nbsp;<strong>home plate</strong>. I wait for the&nbsp;<strong>pitch</strong>. The ball comes. I&nbsp;<strong>swing</strong>. It&rsquo;s a&nbsp;<strong>hit</strong>! I run to first&nbsp;<strong>base</strong>, second base, third base, then home plate. It&rsquo;s a&nbsp;<strong>home run</strong>! The&nbsp;<strong>crowd cheers</strong>! Woo hoo!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Jonathan:</strong> You really love baseball. Have fun at the game, Anna.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Thanks, Jonathan.Taxi!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> Hi, Anna. Where are you going?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Hi, Ashley. I am going to see a Nationals baseball game!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> What time is the game?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> 7 o&rsquo;clock.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> Do you have a ticket?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> No, not yet.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> Anna, you should go a lot&nbsp;<strong><u>earlier&nbsp;</u></strong><u>than 7 o&rsquo;clock.</u></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> That is why I&rsquo;m taking a taxi. Taxi!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> Anna, Anna, that&rsquo;s not a good idea. A&nbsp;<strong>bicycle</strong>&nbsp;is faster than a taxi.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Oh, Ashley. Ashley, Ashley, Ashley. A car is faster than your bicycle.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> In D.C. traffic sometimes a bicycle&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;faster than a car. And right now, there is a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>&nbsp;of traffic.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Good point. But I don&rsquo;t have a bicycle.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> Okay, Anna, you can use my bicycle.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Thanks! I really want to learn how to ride one.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> What do you mean,&nbsp;<em>learn&nbsp;</em>how to ride a&nbsp;<strong>bike</strong>? Oh, Anna! Anna, Anna!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> You know, Anna, the Metro is faster than a taxi and a bicycle. You ought to take the Metro. It&rsquo;s that way.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Good idea.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> OK.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> See you later!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> Bye, Anna!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Bye!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> The Metro was a lot faster than a bus, taxi or bike. And now I&rsquo;m at Nationals Park! Look at all these fans! So many people like to watch baseball. There&rsquo;s the ticket window. What? The tickets are&nbsp;<strong>sold out</strong>? Nooooooo!Nooooooo! But I really want to watch a baseball game. Does anyone have an extra ticket?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Fan:</strong> Next time, you should buy your ticket&nbsp;<strong>online</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Thanks. Thanks a lot. It&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;good advice. Being early is&nbsp;<strong>better</strong>&nbsp;than being late. Until next time &hellip;</p>
