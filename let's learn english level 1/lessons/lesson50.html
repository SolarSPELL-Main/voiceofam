                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Hello, and welcome to Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.! I am going back to school! Georgetown is the oldest <strong>Catholic</strong> and Jesuit university in the United States. The Jesuits are a religious order known worldwide for their many colleges and universities. Students have been <strong>studying</strong> here <strong>since</strong> 1792!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Sarah: </strong>Hey, are you finished with your <strong>report</strong>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Taylor: </strong>Almost. I have been writing and re-writing since last night! The subject is really interesting to me.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Sarah: </strong>Me too! I have been studying this topic* for a long time.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Am I late?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Sarah: </strong>You’re a little late. But don’t worry. The <strong>professor</strong> isn’t here yet.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>How long has the class been waiting?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Taylor: </strong>We’ve only been waiting for about 10 minutes.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Oh good. Oh, no! I forgot my <strong>pencil sharpener</strong>. Excuse me, do you have a pencil sharpener I can borrow?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Taylor: </strong>No, sorry.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Oh wait. I found my extra one! Whew, that was close.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>So, how long have you been studying at Georgetown?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Andrew: </strong>I’ve been studying here since 2015.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Awesome. You know, I've been wanting to go back to school for a long time. So, here I am!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Andrew: </strong>Well, you picked a great school. I’ve been really happy here.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Awesome. See, I’ve been working for several years now. So, going back to school makes me a little nervous.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Randall: </strong>Don’t be nervous. Just <strong>pay attention</strong> and do your best!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>That is great advice. You know, I have been paying attention. But sometimes I still feel like I don’t <strong>understand</strong>. Like last week …</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>What’s that?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Jada: </strong>This is my <strong>draft</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>What draft?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Jada: </strong>The professor told us to bring our drafts.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I think she said “<strong>giraffe</strong>.”</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Jada: </strong>No. She didn’t.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Randall: </strong>I’m sure you’ve been understanding just fine.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Here comes the professor.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Dr. Jones: </strong>Hello <strong>class</strong>! Sorry I'm late, but the snow storm made getting here really difficult. I see you’ve been waiting very <strong>patiently</strong>. So, let’s get started! Who wants to give their talk first?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Oh! Oh! Please, please pick me.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Dr. Jones: </strong>Anna?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Who me? Sure. Thanks.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Here is my report on “<strong>Violins</strong> in the City.”</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>People have been looking for a <strong>solution</strong> to the problem of violins in the city. I say stop! Stop! They are not the problem! In fact, violins are part of the solution!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Are you all understanding me? 'Cause you look a little confused. I’ll talk louder. Violins create beautiful music that can fill a city with hope.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Dr. Jones: </strong>Anna …</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>If we put a violin in the hands of every child …</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Dr. Jones: </strong>Anna! The topic is “<strong>Violence</strong> in the city.” Violence. Not violins.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Until next time …</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">The learning strategy for this lesson is <em>Monitor</em>. This strategy is what we use when we are speaking, and we want to know if our listeners are understanding what we say. We also monitor while we are listening, to check on whether we are understanding what we hear.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">In this lesson, Anna goes back to school. She misunderstands the professor, and gives her report on the wrong topic. As she is speaking, she looks at her classmates. Their faces show they are confused. Anna is monitoring here. She tries to talk louder, but they are still confused. Soon the professor corrects her.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">What do you do to monitor when you are speaking in English? Teachers, see the&nbsp;<a href="../../content/let's learn english/Lesson 50_Back to School/Lesson 50 Teaching Resources/Lesson 50 Lesson Plan.pdf">Lesson Plan&nbsp;</a>for more details on teaching this strategy.</p>
