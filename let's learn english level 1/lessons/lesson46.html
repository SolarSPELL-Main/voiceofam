                        <h2>Learning Strategy</h2>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Learning Strategies are the thoughts and actions that help make learning
                            easier or more effective.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">The learning strategy for this lesson is <em>Act it Out</em>. When we act out
                            something, using our body instead of using words, we are finding another
                            way to communicate our meaning. That helps when we do not know a
                            word, or when it is too loud to talk. We can also use this strategy to build
                            stronger memories of the things we are learning.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">In this lesson, Anna wants to ask Jonathan if she can borrow his scissors.
                            But he is listening to loud music, so she <em>acts out</em> using scissors. He
                            understands that she wants to use his scissors easily before he hears her
                            question.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Do you ever <em>act out</em> the new words you are learning in English? Try it with
                            the new words for office supplies in this lesson. Say each word and make
                            an action with your hands as if you are holding or using that thing. Does it
                            help you learn the new words?</p>
