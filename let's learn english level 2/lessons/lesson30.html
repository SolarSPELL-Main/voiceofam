                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Jonathan: </strong>That’s easy. I’d love to win the World <strong>Karaoke</strong> Contest.</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Penelope, I was wondering if you still dream of being a dancer.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>Only every day!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Well, guess what: A famous dancer is having a <strong>flash mob</strong> around the corner! <strong>Hundreds</strong> of people are dancing together!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>No way!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Way! If you leave right now, you can join them! Bye!</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Oh. I plan on selling my book to Hollywood and becoming <strong>rich</strong> and famous.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>That’s going to be difficult.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>It’s my agent! Hello? Uh-huh. Sure! I can be in Los Angeles tomorrow!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Well, good job, Anna! My work here is done … almost.</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Music: </strong>You can search but you won't find the answer without a dream. You can reach for the stars but you won't get there without a dream...without a dream.</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I don’t know. Maybe something is, uh, <strong>going around</strong> the office. </p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>You mean <strong>germs</strong>? Anna, you’d better use some of this hand cleaner. You don’t want to get sick, too.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Right. Okay, thanks. Not germs – dreams, Ms. Weaver. Dreams.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>What did you say, Anna?</p>
