                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>No. Today has been a bust … a flop … a bummer!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>I’m <strong>sensing</strong> a little <strong>disappointment</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>A little?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>My <strong>official</strong> bird-watching form is almost full!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I've only seen <strong>pigeons</strong> ... lots and lots of pigeons! But I did write down some other <strong>valuable</strong> information.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>Did you find a bird's <strong>nest</strong>?! </p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>No.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(She shows Kelly a map of ice cream trucks.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I found 10 ice cream trucks in this five-<strong>block</strong> area.​ Their music seems to follow me everywhere.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>We'<u>re supposed to be</u> counting birds, not ice cream trucks. This is important scientific work!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Well, when you want ice cream, my <strong>data </strong>will be pretty important.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>Anna, birds are everywhere! I’m sure you’ll find something. Use your <strong>imagination</strong>! But, make sure that you put it on the official form.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Anna walks away with her ice cream truck map.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot: </strong>Anna <u>was supposed to find</u> birds, but she didn’t.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot: </strong>Kelly says, “We'<u>re supposed to be</u> counting birds, not ice cream trucks.” <em>To be supposed to</em> means you are expected to do something.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot: </strong>It’s different from <em>have to</em> and <em>ought to</em>. <em>Have to</em> means you must do something. And <em>ought to</em> means you should do it but you don’t have to.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot: </strong>Keep watching for <em>have to</em> and <em>ought to</em>!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Anna looks through <strong>binoculars</strong> but doesn't see birds. She talks to herself.) </em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>No birds. Oh wait, there’s another ice cream truck! Anna, focus on birds. Aw, but that truck has my favorite flavor ... banana! </p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>That man is <strong>in the way</strong>. I can’t see the <strong>price</strong>. I wonder what flavor he's getting.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Strawberry? He doesn't seem like a strawberry kind of <strong>guy</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>In fact, he doesn't seem like an ice cream truck kind of guy. That suit looks expensive.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Maybe he's a spy! You know what that means</strong>The ice cream truck driver is a spy, too!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong><strong>Genius</strong>! It’s a perfect <strong>disguise</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>What?! The man in the suit left his <strong>briefcase</strong> at the ice cream truck!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I was right! He is a spy! And, he just <strong>dropped off</strong> <strong>top-secret </strong>information! I <u>ought to do</u> something. Something needs to be done! I need to do something.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Anna runs to the ice cream truck and takes the briefcase.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I did it! I took the spy’s briefcase!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>What’s that?! The ice cream truck -- it’s following me! It wants the case back! I <u>have to hide</u>. </p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(She runs and hides behind a tree.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>This is my life now -- running, scared, alone.</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>That awful music -- it’s following me everywhere!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(The man sees her at the tree.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Man: </strong>Hey! You found my briefcase.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>You caught me! I mean, I caught you!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Man: </strong>Well, I just want my briefcase. All my poems are in there.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Poems? You’re a poet?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Man: </strong>Well, I'm a <strong>lawyer</strong>. But I write poems, too.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Anna gives the man his briefcase.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>So, you’re not a spy?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Man: </strong>You look disappointed.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>No, that’s okay. It’s not your <strong>fault</strong>. Poems are nice, too. I guess.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Man: </strong>Well, would you like me to read my latest one?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong><strong>Why not</strong>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Man: </strong>On sunny day walks, my hand <strong>reaches</strong> for ice cream from <strong>fragaria</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I love your poem!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Man: </strong>I love ice cream.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Me too.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Man: </strong>What's your favorite flavor?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Banana.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Man: </strong>Well, my favorite flavor is ...</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong><strong>Strawberry</strong>!</p>

                        <h2>Grammar</h2>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">In past Let's Learn English lessons, you learned about the modal verbs <em>have to</em> and <em>ought to</em>. Today, you learned <em>be supposed to</em>. English learners sometimes confuse them:</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em><strong>Be supposed to</strong></em> means to be expected to do something. But, sometimes we use it to say what someone is allowed to do.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Examples:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class = "VOAsmaller">“We're <u>supposed to be</u> counting birds, not ice cream trucks.” -Kelly</li>
                            <li class = "VOAsmaller">I <u>am supposed to meet</u> someone for lunch at noon.</li>
                            <li class = "VOAsmaller">They <u>were not supposed to stay</u> in the store after it closed.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong><em>Have to</em></strong> has the same meaning as <em>must</em>. In American English, <em>have to</em> is much more common than <em>must</em>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Examples:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class = "VOAsmaller">“I <u>have to hide</u>!” -Anna</li>
                            <li class = "VOAsmaller">We <u>have to leave</u> by 9am to catch the tour.</li>
                            <li class = "VOAsmaller">What time do you <u>have to be</u> at work?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong><em>Ought to</em></strong> has the same meaning as <em>should</em>. But, it is less common and more formal. Sometimes, it is used for saying what is probable.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Examples:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class = "VOAsmaller">“I <u>ought to hide</u>!” -Anna</li>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">In friendly situations, we sometimes use informal language to show disappointment.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">For example, Anna says, "Today has been a bust...a flop...a bummer!"</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>Bust</em>, <em>flop</em>, and <em>bummer</em> are three informal words that show disappointment. <strong>Bust</strong> and <strong>flop</strong> mean a complete failure. A <strong>bummer</strong> is something unpleasant or disappointing.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Examples:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li class = "VOAsmaller">I lost my phone. What a <u>bummer</u>.</li>
                            <li class = "VOAsmaller">Last night's event was a real <u>bust</u>.</li>
                            <li class = "VOAsmaller">TThe film was so boring. It was a <u>flop</u>.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Sometimes, we can tell a person nicely that they did not cause the disappointment.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">For example, Anna learns that the man with the briefcase is not a spy. She is disappointed, but says: "<u>No, that’s okay. It’s not your fault</u>."</p>
