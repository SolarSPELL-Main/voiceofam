                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Announcer:</strong> When last we saw Anna, she had made a new friend. And they&nbsp;<u>had been talking</u>&nbsp;about superheroes for a while when suddenly Anna became Lightning Bolt Lady!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Announcer:</strong> She tried to find her superpowers. But it did not go well.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Announcer:</strong> She can&rsquo;t fly, become invisible or create a force field. And she really cannot walk through walls. Ouch, Lightning Bolt Lady.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Announcer:</strong> She&nbsp;<u>had been walking</u>&nbsp;into that wall for about 15 minutes when she had a great idea.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Lightning Bold Lady:</strong> I just had a great idea!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Announcer:</strong> I can&rsquo;t wait to hear this one! But first, let&rsquo;s talk about grammar.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Announcer:</strong> Professor Bot is on vacation this week. I&rsquo;m the announcer. So, I&rsquo;m going to tell you about the past perfect continuous.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Announcer:</strong> We use this verb tense to show that an action started in the past and continued to&nbsp;<em>another&nbsp;</em>time or action in the past.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Announcer:</strong> For example, I said, &ldquo;She had been walking into that wall for about 15 minutes when she had a great idea.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Announcer:</strong> Had been walking is the past perfect continuous of the verb&nbsp;<em>walk</em>. It&rsquo;s had been plus the -ing form of the verb.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Announcer:</strong> You&rsquo;ll hear me use this verb tense a few more times today.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Announcer:</strong> Now, what am I forgetting? Oh right! Lightning Bolt Lady&rsquo;s great idea.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Lightning Bold Lady:</strong> If I want to know my superpowers, I&rsquo;ll need to learn about lightning!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Announcer:</strong> So, she read many books about lightning.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Lightning Bold Lady:</strong> Wow. A&nbsp;<strong>lightning strike</strong>&nbsp;usually lasts less than a&nbsp;<strong>second</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(She tells this to a person and he slowly moves away.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Lightning Bold Lady:</strong> Lightning is really fast and I like speed walking. So, maybe one of my superpowers is super-speed walking!&nbsp;<em>(to stranger)</em>&nbsp;Bye!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(She begins to super-speed walk.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Lightning Bold Lady:</strong> Check! Super-speed walking is definitely one of my superpowers.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Lightning Bold Lady:</strong> Lightning has&nbsp;<strong>millions</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>volts&nbsp;</strong>of electricity.&nbsp;Amazing!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(She puts her hand up and lightning bolts shoot from her fingers.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Lightning Bold Lady:</strong> Wow! I can&nbsp;<strong>charge</strong>&nbsp;a lot of<strong>&nbsp;batteries&nbsp;</strong>with this superpower!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Announcer:</strong> She&nbsp;<u>had been looking&nbsp;</u>for hours for someone to help when she found her chance.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Woman:</strong> Hello? Hello? I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m going to have to call you back. My phone is dying.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Lightning Bold Lady:</strong> Excuse me, I can charge your phone.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Woman:</strong> Really? Thanks!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Lightning Bold Lady:</strong> I&rsquo;m Lightning Bolt Lady!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(She takes the woman's phone and shoots it with a lightning bolt. But it turns into&nbsp;<strong>ashes</strong>. Then, she gives the woman lots of money and smiles and says goodbye.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Announcer:</strong> She&nbsp;<u>had been practicing</u>&nbsp;her superpowers all day. Suddenly, she heard a&nbsp;<strong>terrible&nbsp;</strong>sound &ndash; a child&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>disappointment</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Announcer:</strong> These children tried to light a fire for over an hour. But then, they&nbsp;<strong>gave up</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Parent:</strong> Hey kids, that wood will never burn. It&rsquo;is too wet.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Lightning Bold Lady:</strong> Small humans, what is wrong?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Child:</strong> Stranger danger!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Lightning Bold Lady:</strong> I&rsquo;m Lightning Bolt Lady!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Young Man:</strong> Oh no. It&rsquo;s you.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Lightning Bold Lady:</strong>&nbsp;<em>(to Young Man:)&nbsp;</em>We meet again. And guess what: I found my superpowers.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Child:</strong> Well, we need a fire to toast the&nbsp;<strong>marshmallows&nbsp;</strong>to make&nbsp;<strong>S&rsquo;mores</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Lightning Bold Lady:</strong> I can help.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Young Man:</strong> We don&rsquo;t need a super-speed walker but thanks!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Lightning Bold Lady:</strong> Super-speed walking is just one of my superpowers. I can also do this!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(She tries to use her lightning bolts but it doesn't go well.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Lightning Bold Lady:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Sorry! Let me&nbsp;</em>do it again.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(She lights the fire with her lightning bolts.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Children:</strong> Thanks, Lightning Bolt Lady!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Young Man:</strong> Lightning Bolt Lady</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Lightning Bold Lady:</strong> You&rsquo;re welcome. But you don&rsquo;t have enough&nbsp;<strong>firewood</strong>. Using my super-speed walking, I will get more.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(She super-speed walks around to get firewood.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Parent:</strong> Lightning Bolt Lady, come back! A lightning storm is coming!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Lightning Bold Lady:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Not a chance</strong>! There&rsquo;s not a&nbsp;<strong>cloud&nbsp;</strong>in the &hellip;</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Child:</strong> Lightning Bolt Lady, are you okay?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Child:</strong> Where's your super-suit?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Oh no! I've lost my superpowers!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Young Man:</strong> It's starting to rain. Do you want to go inside and eat some S&rsquo;mores?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> You read my mind.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> You know, I thought mind reading would be one of my superpowers. But it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Child:</strong> That&rsquo;d be a cool superpower. But I&rsquo;d rather be able to talk to animals.</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Now, you try it!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">First, read about the&nbsp;<strong>past perfect continuous</strong>&nbsp;verb tense below. Then, write two or three sentences in the Comments section about an action that started in the past and continued to another time or action.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Be sure to use past perfect continuous in each sentence!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">For example: They&nbsp;<u>had been studying</u>&nbsp;English for two years before they began school in Washington, D.C.</p>

                        <h2>Past Perfect Continuous</h2>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">We use the past perfect continuous verb tense in two ways:</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Use #1</strong></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">To show that something started in the past and continued up until another time or action in the past</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Examples:</p>
                        <ul class = "VOAsmaller">
                            <li>They&nbsp;<strong>had been talking</strong>&nbsp;about superheroes for a while when suddenly Anna became Lightning Bolt Lady!</li>
                            <li>How long<strong>&nbsp;had</strong>&nbsp;Lightning Bolt Lady&nbsp;<strong>been trying</strong>&nbsp;to find her superpowers?</li>
                            <li>She'<strong>d</strong>&nbsp;not&nbsp;<strong>been trying</strong>&nbsp;for more than a day when she found her chance.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Use #2</strong></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">To show that something&nbsp;<strong>caused</strong>&nbsp;something else in the past</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Examples:</p>
                        <ul class = "VOAsmaller">
                            <li>Lightning Bolt Lady was happy because she&nbsp;<strong>had been using</strong>&nbsp;her superpowers all day.</li>
                            <li>The children were disappointed because they'<strong>d been wanting</strong>&nbsp;to make S&rsquo;mores.</li>
                            <li>The young man was surprised when Lightning Bolt Lady arrived because he&nbsp;<strong>had</strong>&nbsp;not&nbsp;<strong>been waiting&nbsp;</strong>for her.</li>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Notice that, with the past perfect continuous, we often shorten the word&nbsp;<em>had&nbsp;</em>with personal pronouns: I&rsquo;d / you'd / he'd / she'd / we'd / they'd.</p>
