                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Professor Bot:</strong> Anna and Ms. Weaver used the future continuous verb tense to talk about the interview.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot:</strong> We use future continuous to talk about actions that will be in progress at or around a time in the future.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot:</strong> For example, Ms. Weaver says, “Tomorrow, you<u>’ll be interviewing </u>musician Emma G.”</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Hello and welcome to The Music! Today, musician Emma G <u>will be joining </u>us here!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> She is a wonderful <strong>songwriter </strong>and an <strong>amazing </strong>singer. And I love her! Let’s give a warm welcome to Emma G!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Hi. Thank you for coming on the show, Emma G.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Emma G:</strong> Of course. It’s great to be here.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Well, we can’t wait to hear you sing. I listen to your music a lot. So, I feel like I know you. Is that strange?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Emma G:</strong> Anna, listening to music can be a very <strong>personal </strong>experience. So, no, that’s not strange.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Good because I made something for you -- a video <strong>scrapbook </strong>of our friendship.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> I took photos of you and added myself. I worked on it all weekend.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Emma G:</strong> Well, that -- that’s strange. Is that even -- is that even <strong>legal</strong>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Now, Emma, let’s talk about your <strong>schedule</strong>. Tell me ... I mean, tell us exactly where you will be and when. Exactly.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Emma G:</strong> Sure. Well, in early June, I<u>’ll be performing</u> at several <strong>venues </strong>across Austin, Texas.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> That’s my vacation week. I can meet you there! We can <strong>tour </strong>the city. We can have lunch.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Emma G:</strong> Um, yeah maybe. Then in mid-July, I’<u>m going to be teaching</u> at a music camp in Chicago.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> I’<u>ll be visiting</u> my sister then. She only lives about six hours from Chicago! I could drive over. We could hang out.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Emma G:</strong> Yeah, uh maybe. You know, maybe now is a good time for some music.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> That’s a great idea. Now, let's hear a song from Emma G.!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Emma G:</strong> I wrote this song a couple of years ago. It’s called “<strong>Wary</strong>.”</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Emma G:</strong> Do you believe in happy endings?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Endings...</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Emma G:</strong> Do you really believe that we could be…</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Be...</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Emma G:</strong> I think something is wrong. I hear a voice in the <strong>background</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Sorry. Sorry, Emma. That was me. I’m just so excited.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Emma G:</strong> No problem. I'm glad you like the song.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> You go ahead. You go ahead.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Emma G:</strong> Okay. Do you believe in happy endings?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(She hears a <strong>tambourine</strong> playing and looks at Anna.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Emma G:</strong> Anna, there’s no tambourine in this.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry, Emma. See, I’ve always wanted to sing with you.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Emma G:</strong> Well, come on over then and we can sing a song together first.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> No, I couldn't.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Emma G:</strong> Come on. It’ll be fun.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Okay! Here. I brought my favorite song.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Emma G:</strong> Oh, uh okay. Actually, I like this song. Um, are you ready?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Yes! Yes!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Emma G:</strong> Okay.</p>
