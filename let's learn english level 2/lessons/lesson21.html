                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> No, not this time. I was <u>talking</u> to Pete.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> How’s he doing?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Good. He has a birthday coming up! But he told me not to tell anyone.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> Why?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Well, from the way he was <u>speaking</u>, I don’t think he likes <strong>cake </strong>or <strong>presents </strong>or fun.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> That sounds like Pete.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Well, I don’t care. I’m getting him a present. Do you know where I can buy something <strong>unique</strong>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> I do -- Tanglewood Works. You will <strong>definitely</strong> find something unique there.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Great. I’ll go this weekend. Now, <u>speaking</u> of Pete’s birthday, what else should I do? I know. I’ll rent him a clown!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> Yeah, he’ll never <u>speak</u> to you again.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Professor Bot:</strong> Did you hear Ashley and Anna using the words <u><em>talk</em></u> and <u><em>speak</em></u>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><u><em>Talk</em></u> and <u><em>speak</em></u> both mean “to say words.” And, many times, you can use either word without losing any meaning. But there are some differences in when we use these words.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">The word <u><em>talk</em></u> is usually used:</strong></p>
                        <ul class = "VOAsmaller">
                            <li>for conversations between two or more people</li>
                            <li>and informal situations, such as between friends or family</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">For example, Ashley asks Anna:</strong> “Are you talking to yourself again?”</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><u><em>Speak</em></u> is usually used:</strong></p>
                        <ul class = "VOAsmaller">
                            <li>for one-way communication, such as <strong>presentations</strong></li>
                            <li>formal <strong>situations</strong>, such as a boss speaking with her workers</li>
                            <li>to talk about language <strong>ability</strong></li>
                            <li>and in <strong>polite requests</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Keep watching, and listen for the words <u><em>talk</em></u> and <u><em>speak</em></u>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Anna goes to Tanglewood Works.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Sue:</strong> Hey there. Welcome to Tanglewood Works! I’m Sue. How can I help you today?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Hi Sue, I’m Anna. A friend told me about your store. She said, “Anna, this place is really unique!”</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Sue:</strong> We are! Here at Tanglewood Works, we <strong>focus </strong>on things that are <strong>handmade</strong>, <strong>reclaimed</strong> and <strong>recycled</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Wow! That is really good for the <strong>environment.</strong></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Sue:</strong> It’s good for you too. <strong>Local </strong>artists made all of these <strong>one-of-a-kind</strong> pieces. And I paint most of the <strong>furniture</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Can I look around?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Sue:</strong> Oh, please do.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Anna walks around the store.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Sue:</strong> So, Anna, do you like to make things?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Me? Oh, no. Every time I try to make something, something goes wrong.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(She knocks down many things.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Oh, sorry. Sorry.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Sue:</strong> It’s okay. Anna, everybody can make something.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Sue, this piece is very interesting!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Sue:</strong> You know, when I found these pieces, they were broken and in a <strong>dumpster</strong>. But they <u>spoke</u> to me. And they said, “Save me, Sue! Save me!”</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Sue, what do you mean they “spoke” to you?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Sue:</strong> When I see something special that someone has thrown away, I can almost hear it <u>talk</u>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> It’s not saying anything!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Sue:</strong> Anna, it’s not easy to see the <strong>treasure</strong> in <strong>trash</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Or hear it <u>talk.</u> </p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Sue:</strong> But you can learn. In fact, I teach <strong>private</strong> classes. And one is called Turning Trash to Treasure.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Sue:</strong> Next week, bring in some trash and we’ll turn it into treasure. Just remember – pick some trash that “<u>speaks</u>” to you. </p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Got it! I’ll see you next week!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Professor Bot:</strong> Will Anna find trash that “<u>speaks</u>” to her? What will it say? We’ll find out next week!</p>
