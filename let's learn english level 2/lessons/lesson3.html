                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Today, Pete and I are meeting with a <strong>consultant</strong> who will help us with our new show. Yesterday, Pete had <strong>promised</strong> to meet me here at 8:00 am, but he did not come on time.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof Bot: </strong>Uh-oh. It’s bad to be late for a business meeting. But while we wait for Pete, let’s talk about a new verb tense -- past perfect! You know the past tense, right? Like, "Pete promised to meet me here at 8:00 a.m." Past perfect is a little different. When we talk about <em>two</em> things in the past, we can use the past perfect for the first event. Put "had" before the past participle. "Pete <em>had</em> promised he would meet Anna." Here's your assignment: find sentences with the past perfect tense. Remember, look for "had!"</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>You two are late -- <strong>exactly </strong>43 minutes late! What happened?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>He had to get his "special" coffee -- SPECIAL coffee!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>She had to feed her birds -- HER birds!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>Okay, I can see already that you need my help. You can’t both talk at the same time. You have to take turns. Alright, Anna, you go first.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Sure. Kelly, see, Pete and I live in the same building. So, we decided to meet at 8:00 a.m. - 8:00 a.m. to come to work together. I had waited 15 minutes when Pete arrived! </p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>After Pete had <strong>wasted</strong> time waiting for coffee, we were late. I left you a message.*</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>Hum. I didn’t get that message.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Oh. Sorry.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>Pete?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot: </strong>Anna left a message. That’s the right thing to do. Did you find some examples of the past perfect sentences? I did. Anna said, </p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>"After Pete had wasted time waiting for coffee, we were late.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot: </strong>Look at that coffee! It looks more like dessert! Okay, keep watching for past perfect!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Yeah, that’s not why we’re late. This is why we’re late: I had arrived on time at 8:00 a.m. but didn’t see Anna. She was standing behind a tree. I think she was <strong>hugging</strong> it. I always walk to work. But she said that would take too long and that a <strong>scooter</strong> would be much faster. It was awful. I hated it. And it added too much time to our <strong>commute</strong>!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Then Anna stopped by a <strong>pond </strong>to feed the birds. She had named them after characters from books and yelled the names out loud … Romeo! Juliet! Sherlock! </p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">By the time she had fed all the birds, we were late.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>This is what I think. You two see the same <strong>event</strong> very differently. Does this happen often with you two?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Yes.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>No.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>No.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Yes.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>Okay. This is good. This is good! It’s good to see things differently. I have an idea: we will call the show "He Said, She Said." For every story, you tell a different <strong>point of view</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>That is a great idea, Kelly! Pete, we <em>are</em> different. That’s why I thought of you for this job!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>I think you two understand perfectly.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Let’s get to work!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>She named the birds? Really?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Yeah…</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">* Business people in the U.S. think you should come to a meeting at the exact time. If you are late to a business appointment, you should call and explain why.</p>
