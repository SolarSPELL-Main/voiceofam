                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>Me too! Weather is so important.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>It is. It <strong>affects</strong> people’s lives!</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Yes! I <span style="color: blue">had been</span> waiting for that blizzard for years. When it came, I was ready.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot: </strong>Welcome to our most perfect lesson! Why is it perfect? Today we are reviewing the present perfect and past perfect verb tenses. These show that an action is completed.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Kelly uses the <em>present</em> perfect when she says,</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Kelly: <span style="color: blue">Have</span> you ever <span style="color: blue">reported</span> on a big weather event?</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Anna: I <span style="color: blue">had been</span> waiting for that blizzard for years.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Listen for "have" or "had" and the past participle to find more sentences with the perfect tense. I'll <span style="color: blue">color those words</span> to help you.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I <span style="color: blue">have wanted</span> to report on a big weather event my whole life.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>Who hasn’t? Did you report all weekend ... by yourself?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>No, no. I <strong>volunteered</strong> Pete to help me.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Why am I here on a Saturday? Why are you carrying things? Why? Why?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Pete, these are my supplies – food, a blanket; warm clothing. Where are your supplies?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Pete, Pete, Pete. This could be the “blizzard of the <strong>century</strong>.”</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>It’ll be fine.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>How else had you prepared?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Well, I <span style="color: blue">had</span> just <span style="color: blue">bought</span> the latest weather <strong>forecasting software</strong>. So, I brought it!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>Do you mean The Weather Genie Pro?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>You know it. Pete thought it was pretty great too.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Do you have any games on that thing?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Yes! I have the best weather <strong>survival</strong> game. Boom!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Sounds fun.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>It is. But right now, Pete, this computer is a work tool. It will give us the temperature, wind speed, wind direction and <strong>amount</strong> of snowfall … in real time! Boom, boom!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>I can’t wait.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Pete, we need a name for this blizzard.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>No, we don’t.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>All the great storms have names.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>No, they don’t.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I know -- “The Big Snow!”</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>I am <em>not</em> saying “The Big Snow.”</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Welcome to “The Big Snow.”</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>The Big Snow broke all kinds of records, didn’t it?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Yes it did. And every time a record was broken, we celebrated!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>So far, in Washington, D.C. 29 inches of snow has fallen. That, my dear listeners, is a <strong>record</strong>! (<em>Honks horn</em>)</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>We just broke the wind speed record! (<em>Honks horn</em>)</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Snow <span style="color: blue">has been</span> falling for 30 hours <strong>straight</strong>! That’s another record! (<em>Honks horn. Pete comes into room and breaks the horn.</em>)</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>By Saturday night, stores and restaurants <span style="color: blue">had closed</span>. Did you bring enough food?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I thought I <span style="color: blue">had brought</span> enough food. But I ran out.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Hey, Pete, where is my bag of popcorn?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Maybe you ate it already.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>No, I didn’t.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>I haven't seen it. <em>(Pete has popcorn in his beard. Anna tries to hit him.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>We <span style="color: blue">had reported</span> together for 48 hours straight!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kelly: </strong>Wow. That must <span style="color: blue">have been</span> a great team-building exercise for you and Pete.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Yeah. You - you could say that.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot: </strong>I hope you found all the sentences with perfect tenses. Learn more on our website!</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">The learning strategy for this lesson <em>Find and Apply Patterns</em>. That means to look for patterns in what you are learning. For example, we use many patterns to communicate: groups of sounds, letters, and words get our meaning across.<br><br>In this lesson, Pete sees a pattern in Anna's celebration of the weather records. Each time a weather record breaks, she honks her horn to celebrate. Pete does not like the horn, so he breaks it before Anna celebrates the next record-breaking weather fact. He is <em>applying</em> his understanding of a <em>pattern</em> to make his life quieter.<br><br>How about you? How do you <em>find and apply patterns</em>? Can you see patterns in the way people use English? How about in literature? There are also patterns in math, science, history, music and social studies. Can you think of a time when knowing about a pattern helped you to learn something?</p>
