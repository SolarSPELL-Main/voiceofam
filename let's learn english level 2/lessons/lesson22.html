                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> This net <u>said</u> to me, “Anna, I used to catch stuff. I don’t anymore. So, use me, Anna.” That’s what it <u>said</u>. It <u>said</u>, “Use me, Anna.”</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Sue:</strong> Okay. So...it’s a <strong>plastic helmet.</strong></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> This plastic helmet <u>said</u>, “Anna. Hey, Anna, find me a head.”</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Sue:</strong> Okay, um...and a broken toy.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> This broken toy … this broken toy <u>said</u> to me – it said, “Anna, help me find fun.” “Help me, Anna” is what it <u>said.</u></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Sue:</strong> Anna, this stuff is not <u>saying</u> anything to you or me or anyone. It’s what we like to call in the business … <strong>garbage</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> But you <u>said</u> to bring in trash.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Sue:</strong> Sometimes trash is treasure. Sometimes it's just trash.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Sue:</strong> Anna, don’t worry. Next week, I could teach you <strong>decoupage</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Decoupage. Decoupage. That’s fun to say.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Sue:</strong> All you need to bring is a clean shoe box. A box that held shoes. </p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> I got it. I got it! See you next week!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot:</strong> Uh oh. It looks like Anna doesn’t know the difference between treasure and trash. She thinks those things are <em>telling</em> her something!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot:</strong> The words <u><em>tell</em></u> and <u><em>say</em></u> have similar meanings. But we use them in different ways.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof Bot:</strong> <u><em>Tell</em></u><em> </em>means “to inform or instruct <em>someone</em> with words” and is almost always followed by an indirect object. For example, Sue says, “Tell me about that.”</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot:</strong> The word <em>me </em>is the indirect object and tells us <em>who</em> is being told.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot:</strong> <u><em>Say</em></u><em> </em>means “to express something with words” and <strong>focuses</strong> more on the words used. For example, Anna says, “That’s what it said. It said, ‘Use me, Anna.’”</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot:</strong> Listen for when Anna and Sue use <em>tell </em>and <em>say</em>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Sue:</strong> Anna, welcome to Decoupage class. Decoupage is just <strong>gluing </strong>pretty <strong>pictures </strong>onto <strong>stuff</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Sue gets a phone call.) </em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Sue:</strong> Anna, I’ve got to talk to this person. I’ll be right back. Don’t start without me.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Got it.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Sue leaves to take her phone call. Anna gets glue everywhere. She becomes covered with glue and <strong>paper</strong>.) </em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Okay. I can fix this.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Sue:</strong> Anna, what happened? I <u>told</u> you to wait for me!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> <strong>Actually</strong>, you <u>told</u> me not to start without you, which I didn’t. Your glue is really <strong>sticky.</strong></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Sue:</strong> Next week, let’s try lamp making. There’s – there’s no glue. Here's a <strong>flier</strong>. </p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Thanks. See you next week.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Sue:</strong> Anna, you did really well this week. I think lamp making might be your <strong>thing</strong>!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Thanks, Sue. I did everything you <u>told</u> me to do.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Sue:</strong> Remember:</strong> I <u>said</u> to read the instructions really carefully. Where are those instructions?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Let’s just <strong>plug </strong>it in!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Anna plugs in the lamp and, suddenly, the city loses <strong>electricity</strong>.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> So, what class will you be teaching next week?</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em><strong>TELL</strong></em> <em>means “to</em> inform or instruct someone with words.” We use an indirect object (personal pronoun) with <em>tell</em> to say <em>who</em> is receiving the information.</p>
