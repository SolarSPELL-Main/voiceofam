                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Hello! What are you guys looking at?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> I’m showing Ashley pictures of my <strong>girlfriend</strong>. We have so much <strong>in common</strong> -- even small things. She can’t <strong>whistle</strong> and I can’t either.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> (<em>to Pete</em>) And here’s a picture of my <strong>boyfriend</strong>. (<em>sighs</em>)</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> My family is big and so is his. I don’t like ball sports and he doesn’t either! (<em>sighs</em>) We are made for each other ...</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> … and so are we. (<em>sighs</em>)</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Uh … you have found perfect <strong>partners</strong> … and so have I!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Professor Bot:</strong> Pete and Ashley are talking about people they love. They are putting two ideas together with connectors.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Let’s start with these two sentences: She can’t whistle. Pete can’t whistle. How do you put them together?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Pete says, "She can’t <strong>whistle</strong> and I can’t either."</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">You can see we just add the conjunction “either” and take away the verb “whistle.” And Ashley says: "I don’t like ball sports and he doesn’t either!"</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Keep looking for connectors!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> You met someone, Anna? That’s great! What’s his name?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> His name? His name is uh … (<em>stalling, looks around, sees a bus</em>) Bus … ter. (<em>stalling, looks around, sees a car</em>) Car … ter.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> (<em>says it like Anna did</em>) Bus...ter Car...ter?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> It’s just Buster Carter, Ashley. I like him and he likes me. We’re a great <strong>couple</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> Hey, let’s all get dinner tonight, together. You can bring Buster.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> (<em>laughing</em>) Yeah, I can’t wait to meet him.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Thanks, Ashley, but he’s really busy tonight with his uh, (<em>looks around, sees squirrel</em>) <strong>squirrel collection</strong>. Bye, guys! Gotta go!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> Squirrel collection?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> You know, she <strong>made</strong> all that <strong>up</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> That’s so sad. She needs to meet someone. Hey, do you know anyone who she might ...</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> No.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> (<em>to herself</em>) Anna, Anna, you lied! You <strong>lied</strong>! Now, they think you have a boyfriend - with a squirrel collection. Here, squirrel. (<em>throws food</em>) Well, you need to tell them the <strong>truth</strong>. You don’t have a boyfriend.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Man:</strong> Excuse me, is this seat taken?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">(<em>Anna shyly shakes head “no”</em>)</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Ashley, Pete, I need to talk to you. This morning, I lied.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Let me guess. There’s no Buster Carter. What a surprise!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> I’m sorry. But later I really did meet someone and we have a lot in common!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">He’s good at flying <strong>kites</strong> and so am I.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">He likes to read comics and so do I.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">I can play the ukulele and so can he.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> He sounds perfect for you, Anna. Can he come tonight?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> That’s the sad part. You see, he just got a job as a spy, and tonight he leaves on assignment.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Of course he does.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> But that's okay, because now I know that there is someone out there made for me. (<em>looks at the time</em>) Oh, it’s late! I have <strong>to see</strong> him <strong>off</strong> at the train station. Bye, you guys!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> Bye Anna! Oh dear, she’s worse than we thought.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> She’s lost her mind.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> What should we do?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> (<em>happy, excited</em>) Let’s tell her!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">(<em>Pete goes to leave but Ashley pulls him back.</em>)</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ashley:</strong> No, Pete. <strong>Mr. Right</strong> may not be real but he makes her really happy.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Professor Bot:</strong> Did you find any other connectors? Notice how the words are in a different order in the part after “so.” "I am" becomes "am I" and "he can" becomes "can he."</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">"He’s good at flying kites and so am I. I can play the ukulele and so can he."</p>
