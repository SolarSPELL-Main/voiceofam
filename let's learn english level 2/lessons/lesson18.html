                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Professor Bot: </strong>In Part 1 of this two-part lesson, Ms. Weaver gave Anna and Pete an assignment. <u>Ms. Weaver instructed them to do everything by themselves.</u></P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">“Themselves” is a reflexive pronoun.</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">In today’s lesson, Ms. Weaver will look at Pete’s and Anna’s research. First, let’s see Pete’s experiment.</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Pete throws the bag of flour on his chair and throws many other things on his flour baby. Next, we see him outside enjoying <strong>ice-cream</strong> without his flour baby.)</em></P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>Okay, Pete, let me see your research first.</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Pete hands her a big <strong>binder</strong> filled with research.)</em></P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>That’s a heavy binder. And you and your Baby look great.</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Thanks, Ms. Weaver. We feel great!</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>Anna. Anna, you’re next. Anna? Anna wake up!</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(She wakes up but is very confused.)</em></P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I'm here, Baby! I’m here! I’m here! Here's your <strong>bottle</strong>.</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(She accidentally <strong>squirts</strong> her bottle and milk goes everywhere.)</em></P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>Anna, you and your baby look awful. What happened?</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Well, I took her everywhere. Everywhere. And I fed her every three hours. So, I haven’t slept since … what day is it?</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>It’s Friday. What happened there?</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Ms. Weaver points to a large <strong>bandage</strong> on Anna’s flour baby.)</em></P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Oh, that. Oh, that. <u>I was making myself a salad</u> and had a little accident with a <strong>knife</strong>. I put my flour baby in front of me. And then I <strong>accidentally</strong> stabbed it. But I gave it <strong>First Aid</strong>!</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>Is that a <strong>burn</strong>?</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Yes. Yes it is. <u>While I was making myself dinner, I put Baby next to me.</u> I accidentally <strong>knocked</strong> her into the sink. So I put her in the <strong>microwave</strong> to <strong>dry</strong>. That’s when she caught fire.</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Pete smiles, thinking he’s won.)</em></P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Professor Bot: </strong>Okay. So, we use a reflexive pronoun when it refers to the subject of a sentence or clause.</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">But we DON’T use a reflexive pronoun with prepositions of place.</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Anna uses examples of both in one sentence: <u>While I was making myself dinner</u>, <u>I put Baby next to me.</u></P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">We use a reflexive pronoun in the first part of the sentence. “Myself” refers to the subject “I.”</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">But in the second part of the sentence, we don’t use a reflexive pronoun in the prepositional phrase. We use the pronoun “me.” Why? “next to” is a preposition of place.</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Back in the meeting room, we’re about to learn who won the parenting experiment. Pete is smiling, thinking he won.)</em></P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>Anna, Anna, <u>you should be very proud of yourself.</u></P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Proud? She <strong>stabbed</strong> and <strong>burned</strong> her baby!! And she only did one page of research…and it’s covered in milk. Ew.</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>Yes, Pete. But she followed instructions.</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Hey, I did ...</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>Please, Pete. Anna, I think your baby has lost some weight. Is there something else you want to share?</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Yes. I’d like to share … these! <u>I made them myself this morning.</u></P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>You baked your baby? <u>You should be <strong>ashamed</strong> of yourself!</u></P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I baked them at the end of the experiment, Pete. At that point, this was just a bag of flour.</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>It was always just a bag of flour!!</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong><u>Pete</u>, <u>will you listen to yourself</u>?! You sound crazy.</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>I sound crazy! This whole experiment was crazy!! She was the one who carried around and fed it and ...</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Anna puts a <strong>cookie</strong> into his mouth. He chews it and begins to smile.)</em></P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Mmm. That is good.</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(They all agree and eat the cookies.)</em></P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Professor Bot: </strong>So, what have we learned? We’ve learned when to use reflexive pronouns and when not to.</P>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Go to our website for more information! You can practice using reflexive pronouns in our comments section.</P>

                        <h2>Practice</h2>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">In last week's lesson, Professor Bot taught you when to use reflexive pronouns. This week, he teaches you when <em>not</em> to use them.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Now, you try it!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Use the Comments section below and tell us about a time when you did something <em>yourself</em>, or a person or people you know did something by <em>himself</em>, <em>herself</em>, or <em>themselves</em>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">For example:</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>After the holiday dinner, <u>I washed all of the dishes <strong>myself</strong></u>. ("I" is the subject and "myself" is the reflexive pronoun.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Subjects and their reflexive pronouns:</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">&emsp;<em>I…myself</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">&emsp;<em>You…yourself</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">&emsp;<em>He…himself</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">&emsp;<em>Her…herself</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">&emsp;<em>One…oneself</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">&emsp;<em>It…itself</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">&emsp;<em>We…ourselves</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">&emsp;<em>You…yourselves</em></p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>They will meet at The Studio next Friday. (right)</em></p>
