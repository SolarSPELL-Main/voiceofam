                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Yes, it is!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Professor Bot: </strong>Oh dear. Anna and Pete do not agree about Circus Arts. But that's okay. Today&rsquo;s lesson is about agreeing and disagreeing. Let&rsquo;s listen to how Anna and Pete disagree or agree. Let&rsquo;s hope these two can agree on something.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Today, let&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>run away with</strong>&nbsp;the circus!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Recently, I went to a circus festival. There was a huge circus tent. And many different circus performers. It was a celebration of circus arts!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>That looks fun, Anna. But I don&rsquo;t think circus performers are artists. I think they&rsquo;re&nbsp;<strong>athletes</strong>&nbsp;with interesting skills &hellip; and costumes.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Hmm, that is a very interesting point of view, Pete. And I completely disagree.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Anna,&nbsp;<strong>Michelangelo&nbsp;</strong>was an artist.&nbsp;<strong>Rembrandt&nbsp;</strong>was an artist. People who swing from&nbsp;<strong>ropes</strong>&nbsp;are not artists. I know it&rsquo;s not easy to swing from a&nbsp;<strong>bar</strong>&nbsp;and catch someone by the hands. You have to be very&nbsp;<strong>athletic</strong>&nbsp;to do that.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>That&rsquo;s a good<strong>&nbsp;</strong>point, Pete. They&nbsp;<em>are&nbsp;</em>athletic. But they are called&nbsp;<strong>trapeze</strong>&nbsp;artists. Trapeze &hellip; ARTISTS.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>I hear what you&rsquo;re saying, Anna. I do. But where is the art? Look at these guys. They&rsquo;re jugglers.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Yes, they are skilled in the&nbsp;<em>art&nbsp;</em>of juggling.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>They have a special skill. But are they artists?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Yes!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>No!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>They're just throwing things&nbsp;<strong>back and forth.</strong></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Kind of like you and me, Pete. We&rsquo;re going back and forth on this issue.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll ever agree on this one.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>No, but we can agree that these young people are amazing.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Okay, yeah. We can agree on that. But, still, they are very athletic &ndash; flipping and throwing each other around.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Yes, I agree with you on that point.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Professor. Bot: </strong>They did it! They agreed!! Anna says she agrees that the performers are athletic. "That&rsquo;s a good<strong>&nbsp;</strong>point, Pete. They&nbsp;<em>are&nbsp;</em>athletic. I agree with you on that point. " Now look for other ways they agree.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Anna? Anna!!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Sorry! Sorry! But he&rsquo;s an artist too. He is telling a story with his sticks and his costume.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>What story? What costume?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I see your point, Pete. I really do. But circus performers do more than physical tricks. Look! Look at these amazing performers!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>I will&nbsp;<strong>admit</strong>&nbsp;-- I like&nbsp;<em>their</em>&nbsp;costumes.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>You know, Pete. Let&rsquo;s let the performers speak for themselves.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Kate and Piper tell stories while&nbsp;<strong>hanging</strong>&nbsp;upside down on a&nbsp;<strong>ring</strong>!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Was it hard to interview them upside down?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I interviewed them&nbsp;<strong>right side up</strong>, Pete. Kate says circus performing may be athletic but it&rsquo;s not&nbsp;<strong>competitive</strong>. With most sports, you compete.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kate: </strong>It&rsquo;s an art form because like, other sports are competing. This is simply performing and having fun.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Okay, Kate made a really good point. In athletics, there&nbsp;<em>is&nbsp;</em>a lot of competition. But still &hellip;</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Here&rsquo;s Piper, Pete. Please pay attention, Pete.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>But, I -</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Shh.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Piper: </strong>Well, when you&rsquo;re up in the air doing circus you have to perform. And so, we learn to&nbsp;<strong>embody</strong>&nbsp;characters, and to move fluidly and&nbsp;<strong>gracefully</strong>&nbsp;&hellip; in artistic ways.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>And that &hellip;is why they are artists!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>You&rsquo;re right, Anna. Oh, you&rsquo;re right. It&rsquo;s just so beautiful.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I know. I know, Pete.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Professor Bot: </strong>Good job you two! I'm so glad that Anna and Pete finally agree! Pete said, " You&rsquo;re right, Anna." I agree, too. Circus arts are beautiful. Remember the website!</p>

                        <h2>Learning Strategy</h2>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">The learning strategy for this lesson is&nbsp;<em>Apply a rule.&nbsp;</em>When you use English, you often apply rules you have learned. If you are not sure about how to say something in English, you can look for a rule that will help you.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">In this lesson, Anna and Pete are talking about circus performers. Are they artists or athletes? Anna thinks of this rule: 'athletes compete in sports.' The performer Kate says circus performing may be athletic but it&rsquo;s not competitive. Anna helps Pete to understand that circus performers are artists because, as Piper says, they move "in artistic ways."</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">How about you? How do you apply rules<em>&nbsp;</em>while you are speaking English? Can you think of an example of a rule that you applied recently?</p>
