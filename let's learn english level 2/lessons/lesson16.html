                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kaveh: </strong>Ooh, I know a great place. When I first started working here, <u>I would go every day</u>!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Great. Oh, no.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kaveh: </strong>What’s wrong?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I lost my key! I just had it this morning.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kaveh: </strong>You should check the <strong>Lost & Found</strong> office.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Great idea. Where is it?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kaveh: </strong>Oh, <u>it used to be across from the <strong>cafeteria</strong></u>. But now it’s down in the <strong>basement</strong> next to the <strong>elevators</strong>. It’s really hard to find.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>The Lost & Found is hard to find. That’s funny.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kaveh: </strong>It is.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Professor Bot: </strong>I hope Anna can find the Lost & Found office!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>Used to</em> and <em>would</em> describe something that happened repeatedly in the past.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Kaveh uses <em>would</em> when he says, “When I first started working here, I <u>would</u> go every day!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">There are two differences between <em>used to</em> and <em>would</em>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Number 1: We use <em>would</em> only when we say the time period first.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Number 2: For verbs like <em>be</em>, <em>think</em>, <em>feel</em>, <em>see</em> and <em>understand</em>, we can only use <em>used to</em>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Kaveh says, "It used to be across from the cafeteria."</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Keep listening for more!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">(A worker moves the sign for the Lost & Found office. So, Anna walks into the wrong office without knowing it.)</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Serenity: </strong>Come in! I am <strong>Serenity</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Hi, Serenity. I’m Anna!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Serenity: </strong>Please, sit down. How can I help you?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> I lost something very important.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Serenity: </strong>Shh. I already know. You need help.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Yes. I need help finding the key …</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Serenity: </strong>Shh. You need to find the <strong>key</strong> – the key that will give you happiness.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Yes. Finding this key will make me very happy.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Serenity: </strong>First, Anna, let me tell you a little bit about myself.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Okay.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Serenity: </strong><u>I used to be a very important person with a very important job</u>. I made a lot of money -- I mean a lot.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Wow. Good for you!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Serenity: </strong>No! No, it was bad for me. I lost the most important thing – the key! You’ve lost it too, haven’t you, Anna? Haven’t you?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I guess. So, how does this work? Do I have to fill out a <strong>form</strong> or something?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Serenity: </strong>No. No forms. Just answer this one question: <u>As a child, what did you use to do to feel happy?</u></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>When I was little, <u>I used to sing all the time with my family</u>. Those were good times.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Serenity: </strong>Singing is so <strong>joyful</strong>! <u>I used to sing.</u> But now that I’ve started my business, I’ve just been too busy. Too busy! Anna, why don’t you sing again?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I sing everywhere! I sing in the office. I sing on the metro. I sing in the elevators. I sing on the <strong>escalators</strong>. I sing in the bathroom. Serenity! Serenity! I really need to find my key. Yeah!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Serenity: </strong>Yes, we need to find the key … the key to happiness.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>No, no. I just need to find the key to my apartment.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Serenity: </strong><u>I used to know.</u> But now I don't! Do you, Anna?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I don’t know. I think I left it in the ladies’ room. You know, this isn’t the Lost & Found, is it?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Anna starts walking out of the room)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Serenity: </strong>It could be the Lost & Found. I’m lost! <u>And I used to find <strong>joy</strong> for people! I used to find joy</u>!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>You know, this is a bad time for you. I’ll find the Lost & Found myself. Bye, thanks.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Serenity: </strong>I used to find joy. I used to find joy! I used to find joy!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Ah, I found my key!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Serenity: </strong>I used to find joy!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pofessor Bot: </strong>Oh no. Serenity lost her joy. But at least Anna found her key! Check out our website for more!</p>

                        <h2>Practice</h2>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Now, practice the grammar you just learned. Use the Comments section below to tell us what you used to do to feel happy.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Remember to follow these rules:</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Rule # 1</strong>: Use would only when you introduce the time period first.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">You can mention the time in the same sentence:</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">"When I first started working here, I would go every day!"</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Or, you can mention the time in the previous sentence:</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">"When I first started working here, I did not bring lunch from home. I would go to restaurants every day.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Rule # 2</strong>: For stative verbs, only use used to. A stative verb is a verb used mainly to describe a <strong>state</strong> or situation rather than an action.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Two examples from today's lesson:</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Serenity: "I used to know. But now I don't"</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Kaveh: "It used to be across from the cafeteria.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">There are many stative verbs in English. Some examples include: be, know, think, feel, see, understand, want, like, love, hate, wish, mean, remember, taste, believe, hear, look and seem.</p>
