                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Yeah, sure Anna.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> I love movies. I love the <strong>plot</strong>! I love the <strong>set design</strong>! I love the costumes! I love -</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong><u>Anna</u>, I <strong>take</strong> movies very <strong>seriously</strong>. You're not one of those people who talks during a movie, are you?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>No.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Good.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Professor Bot: </strong>Anna loves movies. <em>And</em>..she loves talking about movies. And Pete doesn’t sound happy about that.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">But he’s trying to be polite. He can do that with <strong>Indirect Questions</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">We can ask a question <em>directly</em>: Where is your movie theater? or <em>indirectly</em> as Anna does:</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><u>Can you tell me</u> how to get to your movie theater?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">They have the same meaning. But indirect questions are more polite and a little more <strong>formal</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Many indirect questions begin with:</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>Can/Could you tell me…</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>Would/Do you mind…</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>Would it be possible…</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">or</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>Do you know…</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Hmm, do you know if Anna will stop talking? I sure don’t.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Keep watching. And, this time look for indirect questions that begin with: <em>Would you mind…</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I love the smell of popcorn. I love seats that <strong>rock</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Her chair makes noise as she rocks back and forth.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>I love when people are quiet.</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Ooh look, the <strong>previews</strong> are starting. I love to see what movies are coming out. Oh, this one looks good!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Anna, the previews are part of the movie experience. <u>So</u>, <u>would you mind not talking</u>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Oh, sure, sure.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Anna eats her popcorn loudly. Then, she begins drinking her <strong>milkshake</strong> loudly.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Anna, I was wondering: are you almost finished with that?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>No. There's still a lot of milkshake at the bottom.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(She drinks loudly again. And again.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Anna, do you mind not drinking so loudly?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I'll try. But it's really <strong>thick</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(She moves the <strong>straw</strong> around and makes even more noise.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Anna, what are you doing?!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(A person in the audience shushes Pete.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Person in audience: </strong>Shh!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Pete tells the person what was happening.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>I’m not the one making all the noise.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Person in audience: </strong>Shhh!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I’m done now.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Anna now holds many noisy boxes of candy. Finally, she chooses a <strong>candy bar</strong>.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Anna, <u>would you mind opening that a little bit more quietly</u>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I'll try.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(She tries to open it quietly but cannot.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Anna, just give it to me!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(He tears it open with his mouth. It makes a loud noise. Again, someone in the audience thinks he is making too much noise.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Person in audience: </strong>Shhh!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong><em>(to the person)</em> It's not mine. I'm opening it for her. Here.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Person in audience: </strong>Shhhhhh!!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(He gives the candy bar quickly back to her.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Here!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Thanks, Pete.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong><u>Now</u>, <u>would you mind being more quiet?</u></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(The light of someone’s phone shines in Pete’s face. He asks the person a question.)</em></p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Then, Anna’s phone rings.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Oh, sorry! I forgot to <strong>turn</strong> my phone <strong>off</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(She tries to turn it off but drops it under the seat.)</em></p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Anna, can you please turn off your phone?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(She speaks to the person Pete just asked to turn their phone light down.)</em></p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Person in audience: </strong>Shhhhh!</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Security guard: </strong>Excuse me, sir. You can’t yell in a movie theater. <u>Would you mind coming with me</u>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>You're <strong>kicking</strong> <em>me</em> <strong>out</strong>? Me? But I’m always the quiet one in the movie!</p>
