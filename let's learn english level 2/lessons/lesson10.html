                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Bruna: </strong>I thought we could meet for lunch today.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I <strong>wish</strong> I could, but I can’t. I have to research Peru for a story.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Bruna: </strong>How’s it going?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Not so good. I’ve been reading about <strong>Peru</strong> and listening to <strong>Peruvian</strong> music. I really want to understand Peru. I hope it's enough.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Bruna: </strong>You should visit Peru.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I wish!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Bruna: </strong>You can!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Bruna, I don’t have the money or time to go to Peru. My <strong>deadline</strong> is tomorrow!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Bruna: </strong>No, I don’t mean to really go there. The museum where I work is having a Peruvian festival today! …. Anna? Anna? Anna, are you there?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot: </strong>Hello again! Professor Bot here. Today we will hear about wishes and hopes. Bruna asked Anna to go to lunch, but she answered,</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">I <strong>wish</strong> I could, but I can’t. Listen for more <strong>hope</strong> and <strong>wish</strong> sentences.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Bruna: </strong>Hi, Anna!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Hi, Bruna! Thanks for telling me about this event.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Bruna: </strong>Sure! It's much better than <strong>staring</strong> at your computer. I hope it helps with your story.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I’m sure it will. So, what should we see first?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Bruna: </strong>Dance and music are very important to Peruvian culture, so let’s watch the dancers.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Great! Let’s go!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Bruna: </strong>There's this very special Peruvian dance called Marinera Norteña.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> I love the Marinera Nortina…!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Bruna: </strong>Marinera Norteña.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Marinera Norten…?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Bruna: </strong>No. Marinera Norteña.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I love the … <strong>marriage</strong> dance!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Bruna, I read about this dance. But it is much more <strong>romantic in person!</strong></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Bruna: </strong>The dancers are giving lessons after their performance. You should try it!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I’d love to. But I’m not ready to get married. I mean, one day I hope to meet the right guy. We’ll buy <strong>matching motorcycles</strong> and ride into the <strong>sunset</strong> -- the wind <strong>blowing</strong> through our hair!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Bruna: </strong>Anna, the dance just <em>shows</em> the <strong>courtship</strong> tradition. It doesn’t mean you <em>will</em> get married.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Oh. Well, I’ll try anyway.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Bruna: </strong>Don’t forget. This festival also shows Peruvian art!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> I hope I have time to see everything!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Bruna: </strong>Anna, I wish I could join you. But I have some work to do.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Of course, of course. You go back to work. I’ll check out the art.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Bruna: </strong>Okay, I’m hoping to finish in about an hour. Let’s meet then.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Great. See you then!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Bruna: </strong>See ya!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot: </strong>Did you notice any sentences with hope or wish?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Anna says, “One day I hope to meet the right guy.” That’s an example of using “hope” with an infinitive to talk about doing something in the future. Keep watching!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Oh, wow! I can make my own Peruvian art!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Bruna: </strong>Anna, how’s it going?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Hi, Bruna!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Bruna: </strong>You know you're in the kid's section, right?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I'm in the art making section.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Bruna: </strong>Bruna.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Oh, this one’s not mine. This is mine.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Bruna: </strong>Wow! Really? That's really nice!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Thanks! And thanks for telling me about this festival. I learned so much about Peru. Ooh, we still have time!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Bruna: </strong>Time for what?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Time for Marinera Norteña!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot: </strong>Do you remember what Anna said? “I really want to understand Peru.” I hope you understand Peru a little better now, too. And I wish I could talk with you more about grammar, but that’s all the time we have today! Go to the website to learn more!</p>

For example, when you are learning English there may be some new sounds that you do not have in your native language.<br><br>In this lesson, Anna hears the name of a dance from Peru. Bruna says, "There's this very special Peruvian dance called Marinera Norteña." At first, Anna has trouble saying the name. She says, "I love the Marinera Nortina… !" Bruna says it again, so Anna can hear it correctly. Later, Anna says the name with the correct sound: "Time for the Marinera Norteña!"<br><br>How about you? How do you use sounds or "use your mental tape recorder" ​while you are studying English?</p>
