                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>No way! I think because I’m walking with you, I’m walking faster.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Come on, Penelope. Let's take a break. We've been speed walking since 8 a.m.! You're so <strong>competitive</strong>! You even wore your medals!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>You brought your trophies! You’re out of shape. When we were little girls, we could speed walk all day! <em>(pulls ahead)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong><em>(chases her) </em>Hey, <em>w</em>ait for me! Hey, you know the speed walking rules! If both feet leave the ground, it’s running! You ran!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot: </strong>Anna and Penelope are doing something they both love - speed walking!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">They are also using adverb clauses.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Adverb clauses tell us <em>when, why, how, where </em>and<em> under what conditions.</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">For example, &quot;since 8 a.m.&quot; tells us when.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Adverb clauses are dependent clauses and need an independent clause to make a complete sentence.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Words like <em>before, after, when, because, since, if </em>and <em>even though</em> can signal an adverb clause.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Keep watching for more adverb clauses!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>Whew! That was great!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong><em>(Anna catches up) </em>Wow, Penelope, you’re still really fast! Since I’ve been working in an office, my speed walking has been much slower.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>You are slower, Anna. Maybe you should hire a <strong>personal trainer</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>That will be great. As long as the trainer understands speed walking.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong><em>(hands her a business card) </em>Try this company. After you <strong>fill out </strong>an online <strong>application</strong>, they will match you to the perfect trainer.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>As soon as I get home tonight, I’ll do it! Thanks.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Are you my trainer?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Alaskan Albert: </strong>If you’re Anna, then I’m your trainer -- Alaskan Albert. Because I’m from Alaskan wilderness, I’m <strong>skilled</strong> in all outdoor activities of the <strong>wild</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>That’s great but what about speed walking?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Alaskan Albert: </strong>Speed walking? That's funny! Since I’ve been living in the city, I’ve combined wilderness training with a city workout. I call it “Call of the Wild <strong>Parkour</strong>!” <em>(He howls like a wolf.) </em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Okay … but seriously, when do we speed walk?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Alaskan Albert: </strong>Your <strong>application</strong> did not say how funny you are!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>No. But it did say that I'm a speed walker! Did you read it? Forget it. We'll have to cancel.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Alaskan Albert: </strong>Why?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>We can't train today because it's too cold and too windy.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Alaskan Albert: </strong>No way! <strong>No pain, no gain</strong>! When you exercise in really cold weather, you feel alive!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Really? Because right now I just feel cold.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong> Alaskan Albert: </strong>You're so funny. But seriously, after our training, you will be ready for any <strong>extreme physical challenge</strong>. Let's get started!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(He leads Anna through some parkour exercises.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Alaskan Albert: </strong>Anna, even though you’re trying really hard, you’re really bad at Call of the Wild Parkour. <em>(he howls)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I'm bad at Call of the Wild Parkour because I don’t want to do Call of the Wild Parkour! <em>(she howls)</em> I am a speed walker. It’s what I do. It’s part of who I am.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Alaskan Albert: </strong>Why didn’t you say something?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I did. Several times! You thought I was joking.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Alaskan Albert: </strong>Now I understand. Anna, I can help you., if you<strong> follow</strong> my <strong>advice</strong>, I'll put the speed back in your speed walk.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(He shows her how to improve her speed walking)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Alaskan Albert: </strong>Go, Anna, go!</p>
