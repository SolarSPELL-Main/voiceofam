                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Sure thing, Penelope. You are new to town. And a tour is the best way to see more of the city!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>So, which tour are we taking &ndash; the one that goes&nbsp;<strong>through</strong>&nbsp;the city on a bus? Or the one that goes&nbsp;<strong>along</strong>&nbsp;the river in a boat?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Both!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>What? Anna, this isn&rsquo;t going to be one of&nbsp;<em>those&nbsp;</em>trips, is it?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>No. Follow me.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Professor Bot: </strong>In this lesson, you are going to hear lots of prepositions! What&rsquo;s a preposition, you ask? It&rsquo;s a word that shows&nbsp;<strong>relationships</strong>&nbsp;between things. Anna says they are going on a tour through the city and along the river.&nbsp;<strong>Through</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>along</strong>&nbsp;are both prepositions. Watch for more!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Well, Penelope, there&rsquo;s our ride!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>What is it?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>It&rsquo;s the famous DC Ducks -- the boat with&nbsp;<strong>wheels</strong>! We will ride on the road and then sail on the water!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>Who thinks of these things?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I don't know. But I&rsquo;m glad they do! Let&rsquo;s get&nbsp;<strong>aboard</strong>, Sailor!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>(<em>looking at a brochure about the boat)&nbsp;</em>Hey, did you know that this bus &hellip; um, boat was created during World War II to&nbsp;<strong>carry&nbsp;</strong>people and supplies?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Wow. You know, a tour is so much more interesting with Fun Facts, like that one.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>I agree. I love Fun Facts!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Boy: </strong>Did I hear you say you love Fun Facts?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna &amp; Penelope: </strong>Yeah.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Boy: </strong>Well, I have tons of Fun Facts for this tour!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna &amp; Penelope: </strong>Great!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Penelope, where are his parents?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>Maybe - maybe he&rsquo;s the&nbsp;<strong>Captain</strong>&rsquo;s son and he helps his dad on tours!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Oh yeah! It would be so awesome to ride around the city in a boat all day with your dad!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>This is amazing, Anna. There are so many beautiful buildings along this road!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Hey, the Washington Monument is on the left!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Professor Bot: </strong>I have a Fun Fact too! Did you know that the Washington Monument was damaged in an earthquake? Whoa. Did you feel that?!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">I heard: "<strong>around</strong>&nbsp;the city&nbsp;<strong>in</strong>&nbsp;a boat," "<strong>along</strong>&nbsp;this road and "<strong>on</strong>&nbsp;the left." All of these are prepositions showing&nbsp;<strong>place</strong>. Let's watch for more places and prepositions!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>Look, Anna, we&rsquo;re&nbsp;<strong>across</strong>&nbsp;from the White House!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Penelope, the only thing between us and the Presiden<u>t</u>&nbsp;is the street &hellip; and a park &hellip; and a&nbsp;<strong>security gate</strong>&nbsp;.... and police officers &hellip; with guns.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Boy: </strong>Excuse me, do you want to know a Fun Fact about the White House?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna &amp; Penelope: </strong>Yes!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Boy: </strong>Inside the White House there is a swimming&nbsp;<strong>pool</strong>, a movie theater and 32 bathrooms!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>Thirty-two bathrooms! That&rsquo;s a lot of bathrooms!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Boy: </strong>I&rsquo;d be happy with two. I live in a house with my mom, four sisters, two aunts and only one bathroom!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>Oh my! You know, Anna, we should give him a&nbsp;<strong>tip</strong>!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Of course! It is polite to tip your tour guide! Luckily, I have lots of dollar bills!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>That was a great Fun Fact! Here you go!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Boy: </strong>Thank you! I can tell you Fun Facts all day!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Professor Bot: </strong>Did you hear any more prepositions of place? I heard "<strong>between</strong>&nbsp;us and the president" &ldquo;<strong>inside</strong>&nbsp;the White House" and "<strong>in</strong>&nbsp;a house."</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">And did you hear that the Duck Boat can go&nbsp;<strong>on</strong>&nbsp;the river? I don't believe it. Join us next time to find out which preposition we will use: The boat went ON the river or The boat went INTO the river?</p>

                        <h2>Learning Strategy</h2>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">The learning strategy for this lesson is&nbsp;<em>Access Information Sources</em>. When we are learning about something, we often have several choices for finding out the information we need. Sometimes we can read a book, or look on the internet. At other times, we can ask a teacher, friend or classmate for information. No matter what the source is, you can then add the information to your own knowledge.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">In this lesson, Penelope looks at a brochure to learn more about the tour boat. Then a young man tells her some "Fun Facts" so she can learn more about Washington, D.C.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">How about you? How do you&nbsp;<em>access information sources</em>? When you are learning English, do you look for information in books, dictionaries, or online? Are you able to ask teachers, friends or classmates to help you by sharing their knowledge of English?&nbsp;</p>
