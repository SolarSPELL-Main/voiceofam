                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Wow. Did you know that <strong>bees</strong> are dying?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kaveh: </strong>That is bad news. If all the bees died, there would be no food. Bees are very important</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(buzz sound)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Yes, they are. Speaking of bees, one of our little friends is here now.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kaveh: </strong><span style="color: blue">You know, Anna, if you ignore it, it will fly away. But if you swat it, it might sting you.</span></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I’ll ignore it. I can ignore it. See, I’m ignoring it. (<em>she is swatting at the bee)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kaveh: </strong>Anna, are you afraid of bees?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>What makes you say that?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kaveh: </strong>Anna, you should call my friend, Caroline. She is a beekeeper and a bee educator. <span style="color: blue">If you talk to her, she’ll probably help you get over your fear of bees.</span></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I am not afraid of bees.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kaveh: </strong>Here’s her card.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Ahhh!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot: </strong>In this lesson, you can learn about conditionals. They have "if" and "will" or "would." There are two kinds of conditional sentences in this lesson.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Type 1 conditionals have a real event, and a result that probably will happen. Chances are good. Here is the pattern:</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><span style="color: blue">&emsp;If + present tense verb ... will + future tense verb.</span></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Kaveh uses this when he says: <span style="color: blue">"If you ignore it, it will fly away."</span></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Type 2 conditionals have a possible event and a result that may or may <em>not</em> happen. We don't know. Here is the pattern:</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><span style="color: blue">&emsp;If + past tense verb ... would + infinitive verb.</span></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Kaveh uses this pattern when he says, <span style="color: blue">"If all the bees died, there would be no food."</span></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Look for the "if" in a sentence to find more conditionals in today's lesson. I'll color them, too!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I think I'm at the wrong address. This does not look like a place where bees are kept. ​<em>(knocks on door)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Oh, sorry to bother you. I’m looking for beekeeper Caroline. I’m here to take her “Learn to Love Bees!” class.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Caroline: </strong>You’re in the right place! I’m Caroline!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Oh, nice to meet you! Um, Caroline, I thought this class used real bees and real <strong>hives</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Caroline: </strong>It does! <span style="color: blue">If you look in my <strong>backyard</strong>, you will see my bees! I’m a home beekeeper!</span></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>What? You live with bees? That is really amazing! And at the same time really scary.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Caroline: </strong>It’s not scary. <span style="color: blue">If you come, I’ll show you.</span></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Caroline, how many bees are in that hive?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Caroline: </strong>About thirty thousand (30,000) in each.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>What? That's amazing! But, aren’t you afraid that they are gonna come out and kill you?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Caroline: </strong>No, not at all, Anna. Even my children help me. Tell me, why are you afraid of bees?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I don't know. Well, when I was a little girl my mom <strong>ran out of honey</strong>. And I really wanted honey for my pancakes. So, I climbed high into a tree and hit a beehive with a stick … several times. Then I reached inside with my <strong>bare</strong> hands to pull the honey out. That’s when I got stung … a lot.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong><span style="color: blue">Caroline, if you hit a beehive with a stick and reach inside, you might get stung.</span></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Caroline: </strong>No, Anna. <span style="color: blue">If you do those things, you <em>will</em> get stung.</span></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Yes. I did.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Caroline: </strong>And you know that it was your <strong>fault</strong> you got stung, don’t you?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Yes. I did.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Caroline: </strong>Bees know your feelings. <span style="color: blue">And if you stay <strong>calm</strong>, the bees will be calm. If you're nervous, the bees will be nervous. And if bees are nervous, they may sting. So, please be calm.</span></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I will be calm. I am calm. Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Caroline: </strong>Great. Let’s get our equipment on.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Wait! Wait! I’m not ready! I'm nervous! Give me a minute to be calm.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot: </strong>Are you ready for one more conditional sentence?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><span style="color: blue">If you are not afraid, you will join us next time to learn more about bees!</span></p>

                        <h2>Learning Strategy</h2>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">The learning strategy for this lesson is <em>Sequence</em>. That means to look for the order of events in what you are learning. For example, we use a <em>sequence</em> when we write about a process, like how to make a pizza: "first, you mix the dough, next, you make the sauce..."</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">In this lesson, Anna thinks about the <em>sequence</em> of her experience with a beehive as a child. First, she hit the hive with a stick. Next, the bees came out and stung her. They were angry. Thinking about that sequence will make Anna more careful about hitting a beehive with a stick in the future! Caroline agrees: "If you do those things, you will get stung."</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">How about you? How do you <em>sequence</em> when you are learning English? Do you start with easier patterns and move on to the harder ones?</p>
