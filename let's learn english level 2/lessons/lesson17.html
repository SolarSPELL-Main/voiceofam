                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>Anna, Pete, I have a new assignment for you -- a show on <strong>single</strong> parents! What is it like for a mother or a father to raise a child by <u>herself</u> or <u>himself</u>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>We can interview single parents. They can share their <strong>experiences</strong> <u>themselves</u>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>Yes, but you need to experience <strong>parenthood</strong> <u>yourselves</u>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong><u>Ourselves</u>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Peter: </strong>Yeah, how do we do that? We’re not parents.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>I asked <u>myself</u> the same question. I said, "Caty, how are they <strong>gonna</strong> do that?" Then an idea came to me. I will give you the babies!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Professor Bot: </strong>You may be asking <u>yourself</u> the same thing that I’m asking <u>myself</u>: what is Ms. Weaver talking about!? I am sure we will find out shortly.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">This lesson teaches reflexive pronouns.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Reflexive pronouns <strong>refer</strong> back to the subject of a sentence or clause. We use them when the subject and the object are the same person or thing.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">For example, Ms. Weaver says, “I asked myself the same question.”</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">“I” is the subject and “myself” refers back to it. Here, she would not use the pronoun “me.” You need to use the reflexive pronoun “myself.”</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Reflexive pronouns are easy to find: they end in “self” or “selves.” I have a feeling we are going to see a lot of reflexive pronouns. Listen for them!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Pete and Anna continue their meeting with Ms. Weaver. She puts two bags of flour on the table. Pete and Anna still look confused.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>Here are your babies!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Those are bags of flour.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>No, Pete, for the next six days, this is your baby. Here are your <strong>instructions</strong>. Do not leave your babies alone. A baby cannot take care of <u>itself</u>. And you two must do everything by <u>yourselves</u>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">We will meet next Friday. Oh, and the person who does the best research will get an extra day of vacation. Help <u>yourself</u> to a baby.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Pete, look, my baby is organic and whole grain. Your baby is <strong>ordinary</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Pete pushes her flour baby off desk.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong><em>(to Pete)</em> <strong>Monster</strong>! <em>(to Caty)</em> This is a great idea, Ms. Weaver!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Pete and Anna are now outside.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>This is a <strong>terrible</strong> idea.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong><strong>Speak for <u>yourself</u></strong>, Pete! We need to <strong>throw <u>ourselves</u> into</strong> the research! I’m starting right now!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(She leaves but forgets her Flour Baby.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete: </strong>Hey Anna, you forgot your baby!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(She turns and looks at Pete.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Come to mama!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(The bag of flour flies at her. She catches it.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Good girl! Good girl!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Professor Bot: </strong>Singular reflexive pronouns end in “self.” Plural ones end in “selves.”</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Anna says, “We need to throw <u>ourselves</u> into the research!” The subject “we” is plural. So, we must use the plural reflexive pronoun “ourselves.”</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(The parenting research begins. Anna tries to open a baby <strong>stroller</strong> but can’t. A man walking by helps her. She pushes Flour Baby in the stroller but it falls out. On another day, she jogs with it. After several days, she is tired!)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>This is hard! I hope Pete is not doing well. I really need that vacation day!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Professor Bot: </strong>We will all see how Pete is doing in the next episode. We’ll also learn when not to use reflexive pronouns.</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">We use reflexive pronouns when the subject and object of the sentence or clause are the same person or thing.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>Ex: <u>I</u> asked <u>myself</u> the same question.</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Subjects and their reflexive pronouns:</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">&emsp;<em>I…myself</em></p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">A reflexive pronoun can be a direct object, indirect object or an object of the preposition.</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Direct Object:</strong></p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>To show emphasis:</strong></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Sometimes, we use reflexive pronouns simply to emphasize the person or thing in the sentence or clause. In this case, the reflexive pronoun often appears at the end of the sentence:</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>Ex: <u>Anna</u> took care of the baby <u>herself</u>.</em></p>
