                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>Oh, Anna. I’ve <strong>invited </strong>some people to dinner Saturday. We’re going to that new seafood restaurant -- Fish on a Dish.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>Why don’t you join us? My<strong> treat</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Thanks, Ms. Weaver. But I already have plans. My friend has invited me to her <strong>houseboat</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>Houseboat, really? That’s unique.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Yes, it is. <strong>In fact</strong>, I’m thinking of living on a houseboat.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>Aren’t you too tall and <strong>klutzy </strong>to live on a houseboat?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I am not too tall!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">(She knocks over a display board.)</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot VO: </strong>Is Anna <em>really</em> ready for a houseboat?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot: </strong>Ms. Weaver invited Anna to dinner. When we make friendly, informal invitations, we use phrases like “Why don’t…?”</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot: </strong>For example, Ms. Weaver said, “Why don’t you join us? My treat!” That’s: </strong>Why don’t plus the subject plus the simple form of the verb.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot: </strong>Anna responded to the invitation by saying, “Thanks, but I already have plans.” Keep watching for more examples of informal invitations!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Fanny: </strong>Anna, I’m so glad you could come!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Hi, Fanny!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Fanny: </strong>Hi, this is my son, Phoenix.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Hi, Phoenix.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Fanny: </strong><u>How about you give Anna a tour and I will make some lunch?</u></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Phoenix: </strong><strong>Aye, aye, captain</strong>!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Fanny: </strong>Great!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Do you really call her “captain”?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Phoenix: </strong>I <strong>kind of </strong>have to.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>So, Phoenix, I think I’d like to live on a houseboat. Do you like living here?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Phoenix: </strong>I love it! It’s much different than living in a house.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Oh, I bet. I bet you had to get rid of a lot of stuff, didn’t you?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Phoenix: </strong>No way! We moved from a 3-<strong>story</strong> house to a boat! So, we really had to <strong>downsize!</strong></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I’d have to get rid of a lot of stuff. I have a rock collection and I have some really big rocks.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Can you stop this boat from rocking for a minute?<br />
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Phoenix: </strong>No. We’re <strong>floating </strong>on water. I can’t do that.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Well, since you live on the water, aren’t you afraid of <strong>great white sharks</strong>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Phoenix: </strong>No, not really. They don’t live in these waters.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>… that you know of. What about <strong>killer whales</strong>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Phoenix: </strong>No.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong><strong>Electric eels</strong>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Phoenix: </strong>No.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong><strong> Barracudas?</strong></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Phoenix: </strong>No.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong><strong> Piranhas?</strong></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Phoenix: </strong>Uh-uh.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Fanny: </strong>You know, Anna, if you’re afraid of sea life, maybe you shouldn’t live on a houseboat. Do you have any boating experience?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Oh, oh yeah, Fanny. I have <strong>battled</strong> the great waters before -- once on a <strong>swan </strong>boat and once in a duck boat ... bus. It was a boat that turned into a bus.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Fanny: </strong>Yeah, I don’t think that <strong>counts</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Fanny, does this rocking ever bother you?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Fanny: </strong>No, I love it. It goes up and down and side to side and up and down. Anna, I love it!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Because of the rocking, Anna begins to feel <strong>seasick</strong>.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Fanny: </strong>Anna, are you feeling okay?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Yeah, yeah. You know, I just need some fresh air.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Fanny: </strong>Let me open a window for you.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>No, I need some fresh land air. I mean, I need to breathe air on land. Oh, is that the time? I should really be going.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Thanks for lunch, Fanny, and a tour of your houseboat. It’s given me a great idea!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Fanny: </strong>You’re going to live on a houseboat?<br />
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong><strong>Sort of</strong>. Thanks again!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Hi! <u>How would you like to hang out on my boat</u>? Great! See you then!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong><em>(Ms. Weaver </em><em>and Anna sit in a boat on land.)</em></strong></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>…and this is my shark net.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>Thank you for the invitation, Anna.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Of course, would you like more <strong>orange juice</strong>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Ms. Weaver: </strong>Uh...</p>
