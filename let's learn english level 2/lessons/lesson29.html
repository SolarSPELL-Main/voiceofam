                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I’m reading about fire <strong>safety</strong>. Ms. Weaver named me fire safety <strong>monitor</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>But the only time we have a fire emergency is when someone burns a piece of <strong>toast</strong>. </p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>That <em>is </em>true. But fire safety is very serious – very serious. <u>If there is a fire <strong>emergency</strong>, I have to help everyone out of the building</u>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>Well then, <u>if I were you, I’d learn as much as possible</u>. </p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>You’re right. And I know just who to call!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot: </strong>Hmm, I wonder where Anna’s going. Today we are reviewing conditionals and learning helpful language for emergencies.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot: </strong>If Anna studies hard, she’ll be a great fire safety monitor! That’s a conditional. It uses “if” to show that something is true only when something else is true.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot: </strong>Let’s find out where Anna is going. And if you want to learn fire emergency language, keep watching!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Two firefighters welcome Anna to their <strong>firehouse</strong>.)</em></p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>FF H: </strong>Come on in.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Thanks.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>FF H: </strong>This is where the firefighters eat. This is where we rest. This is where we exercise. This is where the firetrucks are parked and <strong>maintained</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>This place is beautiful.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>FF H: </strong>You know, the firehouse is a firefighter’s second home.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Firefighter Jones, Firefighter Hatcher: </strong>Can you tell me some ways to prepare for a fire emergency?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>FF H: </strong>Sure, Anna. There’s one really important thing you can do: </strong><strong>Install a fire alarm.</strong> Test it monthly and make sure the batteries are fully charged.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Let’s talk about those <strong>emergency exits</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>FF J: </strong>In your home, office and schools, know where your emergency exits are <strong>located</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>What about fire <strong>extinguishers</strong>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>FF J: </strong>Everyone should know how to use a fire extinguisher. Have one <strong>handy </strong>and practice using it.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>What if we need to get out?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>FF J: </strong>You should have an <strong>evacuation</strong> plan. And practice getting out safely with <strong>fire drills</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong><u> If I am in a building and it’s on fire, should I use the elevator</u>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>FF H: </strong>No. Always use the <strong>stairs</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>What other safety tips should I know?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>FF J: </strong><strong>Stay low</strong>. Smoke <strong>rises</strong>. The air is <strong>clearer close </strong>to the ground.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Stay low. Anything else?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>FF H: </strong><u>If you </u><strong><u>touch </u></strong><u>a </u><u><strong>door </strong>and it’s hot, don’t <strong>open </strong>it</u>. There might be a fire on the other side.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong><u>What do I do if my clothes <strong>catch on fire</strong></u>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>FF H: </strong>Do not run. <u>If you run, the fire will burn faster</u>. You must stop, <strong>drop </strong>and roll.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>Thanks so much! I’ve learned a lot. And I can’t wait to share this information with others.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>FF H: </strong>Thanks for coming, Anna.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>FF J: </strong>It’s been a pleasure meeting you.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Anna is back at the office talking to Penelope.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>So, Anna, how was the visit to the <strong>fire station</strong>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>I learned a lot! And firefighters have a very difficult job.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>Do you smell smoke?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>No. So, like I was saying, I learned how to …</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>Anna, I smell <strong>smoke</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong><u>If you smell smoke, call the <strong>fire department!</strong></u></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Anna begins to evacuate her coworkers.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong><u>If you smell smoke, get out of the building</u>. Come on people, we have a fire emergency! Leave your things and evacuate calmly and quickly. Very good. Very good.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>We have a fire emergency. No, take the stairs Let’s get out. Let’s get out safely.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Anna and coworkers stand outside of the building.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>We got out in less than 6 minutes! Good job, people! Wait. Where’s Pete?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong>I know where he is. I’ll go get him.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong>No! Never go back into a burning building! The fire department is coming. Stay calm, Pete. Help is on the way! Help is on the way!</p>
