                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> In fact, tonight I&rsquo;m going to the big superhero&nbsp;<strong>convention.</strong>&nbsp;Are you going?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Young Man:</strong> Um, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Well,&nbsp;<u>you'd better</u>&nbsp;<strong>decide&nbsp;</strong>soon. Last year, it sold out.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> So, since we&rsquo;re talking about superheroes:&nbsp;<u>would you rather</u>&nbsp;become a superhero by accident, like Spiderman, or be born a superhero, like Wonder Woman?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Take your time. It&rsquo;s a big question. I thought about it for days &ndash;</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Young Man:</strong> Okay. If I had to choose, I&rsquo;<u>d rather</u>&nbsp;be born a superhero.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong>&nbsp;<u>I&rsquo;d rather</u>&nbsp;become a superhero by an&nbsp;<strong>unexpected&nbsp;</strong>accident!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Young Man:</strong> Aren&rsquo;t all accidents unexpected?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Well, yeah.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Young Man:</strong> What was that!? Are you okay?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> I'm better than okay. I feel&nbsp;<strong>super</strong>!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot:</strong> Oh No! Anna was just hit by lightning. She had better get help.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot:</strong> We use&nbsp;<em>had better</em>&nbsp;to give advice. It is very informal and stronger than&nbsp;<em>should</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>ought to</em>. For example, Anna says: &ldquo;<u>You'd better&nbsp;</u>decide soon. Last year, it sold out.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot:</strong> When we use<em>&nbsp;had better</em>, we usually shorten the word&nbsp;<em>had</em>&nbsp;for personal pronouns.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot:</strong> We use&nbsp;<em>would rather</em>&nbsp;to say what we or someone else&nbsp;<strong>prefers</strong>&nbsp;to do or have. For example, the boy says: &ldquo;Okay. If I had to choose,&nbsp;<u>I&rsquo;d rather</u>&nbsp;be born a superhero.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot:</strong> With&nbsp;<em>would rather</em>, we also shorten the word&nbsp;<em>would</em>&nbsp;when used with personal pronouns. Keep watching and listen for&nbsp;<em>had better</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>would rather.</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Young Man:</strong>&nbsp;<u>You&rsquo;d better</u>&nbsp;see a doctor.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> I&rsquo;ve never felt better!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Young Man:</strong> You were just struck by&nbsp;<strong>lightning</strong>!! And what happened to your hair and your clothes?</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Young Man:</strong> What are you talking about?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> An origin story tells the beginning of a superhero. You should know that.</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Now, I need to find my superpowers --</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Young Man:</strong> Um, I really think --</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Wait. Don&rsquo;t tell me. I&rsquo;ll read your mind. You are thinking you&rsquo;d like to be my super helper.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Young Man:</strong> I was not thinking that.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> ... that you&rsquo;d like to live in a treehouse.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Young Man:</strong> No.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> &hellip; that you should eat more vegetables.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Young Man:</strong> Please, stop talking. You really should get some help.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Mind reading is not my superpower. Maybe I can&nbsp;<strong>become invisible.</strong>&nbsp;I &hellip; am &hellip; invisible!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> You can&rsquo;t see me. Who am I? I&rsquo;m not here. You can&rsquo;t see me.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Young Man:</strong> I can see you and so can everybody else.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> No&nbsp;<strong>power&nbsp;</strong>of invisibility. Maybe I can&nbsp;<strong>create&nbsp;</strong>a&nbsp;<strong>force field</strong>. I feel it working. Nothing can hurt &ndash;</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Someone throws a piece of paper and it hits her head.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Ow, that wasn&rsquo;t very nice. I see I have a lot of work to do. Well, goodbye, non-super person!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Young Man:</strong> Wait.&nbsp;<u>I&rsquo;d better</u>&nbsp;go with you. You might get worse&hellip;if that&rsquo;s even possible.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> That's very nice of you, ordinary&nbsp;<strong>human</strong>. But I&rsquo;<u>d rather</u>&nbsp;go by myself. This is a&nbsp;<strong>quest.</strong></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Young Man:</strong> Every time you speak, I get more confused.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> A quest is a part of all superhero stories. You really need to work on your superhero studies. Now,&nbsp;<strong>stand&nbsp;</strong>back. I&rsquo;ve never flown before.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Young Man:</strong> And you&rsquo;re not flying now.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Flying is also not my superpower. That&rsquo;s too bad. It's going to be expensive to&nbsp;<strong>Uber&nbsp;</strong>everywhere. You know, I'<u>d rather</u>&nbsp;walk. It&rsquo;s a nice day. Goodbye, non-super person.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Young Man:</strong> I am not talking to strangers again.</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">We use the modal&nbsp;<em>had better</em>&nbsp;to give advice and&nbsp;<em>would rather</em>&nbsp;to tell someone about preferences.</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">We use&nbsp;<em>had better</em>&nbsp;to give advice. It is stronger than&nbsp;<em>should</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>ought to</em>. It tells us that there may be&nbsp;<strong>consequences</strong>&nbsp;if a person doesn&rsquo;t take the advice.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Examples:</p>
