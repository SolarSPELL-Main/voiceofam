                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> No one is this&nbsp;<u><strong>handsome</strong></u>.</p>

                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> It is gone?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> No. No. It&rsquo;s still there. There. You got it. But think of it: There could be two of us in the world!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Two Annas?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot:</strong> Two Annas? Today, we&rsquo;re reviewing ways to&nbsp;<strong>describe&nbsp;</strong>and compare people. Keep watching for descriptions of people!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Actually, Anna, maybe your silly article is right. Yesterday at work, I met a woman who&nbsp;<u>looks just like you</u>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Really? Wait, are you&nbsp;<strong>making fun</strong>&nbsp;of me?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Not this time.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> She&rsquo;s<u>&nbsp;tall and has curly hair</u>. But even her face&nbsp;<u>looks like</u>&nbsp;yours. I think she&rsquo;s a career consultant.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> I&nbsp;<strong>bet&nbsp;</strong>she has a lot of great advice. I can&rsquo;t wait to meet her.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Yes, you can. I met her and&nbsp;<u>she is very&nbsp;<strong>difficult</strong></u>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Pete, she&rsquo;s just new. We have to give her a chance. What&rsquo;s her name?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Evelyna or something like that. You can&rsquo;t&nbsp;<strong>miss&nbsp;</strong>her.&nbsp;<u>She always wears a hat</u>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope:</strong> So, Anna, have you met the new consultant yet?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> No. But I&rsquo;ve already heard. We&nbsp;<u>look&nbsp;<strong>alike</strong></u>, don&rsquo;t we?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope:</strong> Yeah, but you don&rsquo;t&nbsp;<u>act alike</u>.&nbsp;<u>You&rsquo;re much nicer than she is.</u></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Maybe she gets nervous at new jobs. Or maybe&nbsp;<u>she's&nbsp;<strong>shy</strong></u><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s not&nbsp;<strong>judge,&nbsp;</strong>Penelope.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope:</strong>&nbsp;<u>She&rsquo;s not nervous or shy. She&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>mean</strong></u>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> You know, we should get to know her better. Let&rsquo;s invite her to lunch!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope:</strong> Sorry but I&rsquo;m busy that day.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Penelope walks away. Anna yells after her.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Oh, that&rsquo;s too bad. Hey, I haven&rsquo;t picked a day yet!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot:</strong> So, did you find anything? Here are a few things I found: Anna uses the words &ldquo;look alike&rdquo; to talk about the new consultant. She says, &ldquo;We look alike, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Prof. Bot:</strong> Penelope uses &ldquo;than&rdquo; and the comparative adjective &ldquo;nicer&rdquo; to compare Anna with the new consultant. She says, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re much nicer than she is.&rdquo; Keep watching for more!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Anna and Pete are playing a game.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> This is going to be so much fun. Boy, I can't wait to play this game.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Evilana:</strong> How much longer are you going to be?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> We&rsquo;ll be just a minute &hellip;</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Anna turns around and sees her look-alike.)</em><strong>Anna:</strong> You must be Evelana. I&rsquo;m Anna. We&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;<strong><u>look-alikes</u></strong>!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Evilana:</strong> No, we&rsquo;re not. And my name is&nbsp;<strong>pronounced&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;Evil-ana.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Oh. This is going to be fun.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Evilana:</strong> You had better hurry up. I need this room for a&nbsp;<strong>lecture</strong>. It&rsquo;s called: "If You Want to Win, Others Must&nbsp;<strong>Lose</strong>." What is all this stuff, anyway?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> It&rsquo;s a game. We&rsquo;re going to play at lunch.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Evilana:</strong> It&rsquo;s a stupid child's game!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> It's a fun game. But yes, it is for children.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Evilana:</strong> Well, you may be&nbsp;<u>childish</u>&nbsp;but I&rsquo;m not. And you&nbsp;<u>look stupid</u>&nbsp;with that thing on your head.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Well, you&nbsp;<u>look serious</u>&nbsp;with that look on your face. Come on, Pete. Let&rsquo;s play somewhere else.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Actually, I&rsquo;m going to stay for Evilana&rsquo;s lecture.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Fine. You can learn new ways to&nbsp;<strong>beat&nbsp;</strong>people.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Evilana:</strong> He will. He will.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(Days later, Anna and Penelope are playing the game. Pete comes in. He has a problem with his eye.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Okay. Am I a food?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope:</strong> Nope.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Hey, do you guys have room for one more?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope:</strong> Sure, Pete! Come on over. What happened to your eye?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Pete:</strong> Evilana &ldquo;accidentally&rdquo; hit me. And she didn&rsquo;t even say sorry. She&rsquo;s so mean!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope:</strong> I told you so.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Here, Pete. Put on this&nbsp;<strong>headband</strong>. You&rsquo;ll feel better. Penelope, you&rsquo;re right.&nbsp;<u>Evilana is an awful person</u>!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope:</strong> And&nbsp;<strong><u>violent</u>.</strong>&nbsp;And now we have to work with her!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> Haven&rsquo;t you heard? She&rsquo;s gone! She was given another assignment.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope:</strong> What assignment?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna:</strong> I&rsquo;m not sure. I think it has something to do with outdoors. Anyway, let&rsquo;s play! Pete it&rsquo;s your&nbsp;<strong>turn.</strong></p>
