                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong> Anna, did Ms. Weaver give us instructions for <strong>covering </strong>the car show?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> She did. <u>She said that we need to show lots of cars. She said we need to interview people</u>.<u> And she also said that we should have fun.</u></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong> Those were her <strong>exact</strong> words?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> Yeah. She said, “Have fun, Anna!” And she <em>is</em> the boss. </p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> <em>(to Rick) </em>Okay, Rick, are you - are you ready? OK. Hello, I'm Anna Matteo. Welcome to the Washington Car Show!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> <u>People all over town are saying that if you like cars, this is the place to be</u>! So, let's see what people are talking about. <em>(at Rick) </em>How was that? Okay? Is that Good?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Professor Bot: </strong> Anna, Penelope and Rick are making a news story about the Washington Car Show. Ms. Weaver gave them instructions.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">We often need to tell others what someone else said.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">There are two ways to do this. One is to use the person’s <em><u>exact</u></em> words and use quotation marks. We call this "direct speech."</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">For example, Ms. Weaver had said, “You need to show lots of cars.”</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">The other way is to talk <em><u>about</u></em> what someone said. We call this "reported speech."</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna tells Penelope: </strong> <em>She said that we need to show lots of cars.</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">In this sentence, "she," is the subject, “said” is the reporting verb, “that” is the conjunction and “we need to show lots of cars” is the reporting clause.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller">Keep watching, and listen for sentences where Anna talks about what someone else said!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> This car show has many styles of <strong>vehicles</strong>. There are <strong>utility vehicles</strong>,<strong> classic cars</strong>, trucks, <strong>sports cars</strong>, and <strong>everyday</strong> vehicles.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong> Okay, I think we got good interviews.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> Me too! People had very different <strong>opinions</strong>. <u>But they all said they loved cars</u>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong> Anna, look -- a robot!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> A robot!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong> A robot!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> Rick, we have to use the robot in the show!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(They walk over to the robot. Anna begins to dance like a robot.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Robot: </strong> What is your first name?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> Anna! Anna!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Robot: </strong> Anna, you know, what an <strong>effort</strong>. What an effort to robot dance. How about a<strong> round of applause</strong> for Anna! I’ve never seen anyone try so hard.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> Penelope, did you hear that? <u>Hank the Robot said that he has never seen anyone dance like me.</u></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong> Uh, I think many people here are saying that, Anna. </p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> That was fun. You know what someone told me? You can <strong>test drive</strong> a Jaguar at this car show.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong> Now, <em>that</em> sounds fun.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> Let’s go.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong> Okay.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> This <strong>course </strong>is <strong>smooth</strong>. So you can drive faster.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> He said...that I can’t drive, <strong>unfortunately</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><em>(They begin the test drive. Kurt, the <strong>stunt driver</strong>, does the driving.)</em></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> Oh my gosh…<strong>reverse.</strong></p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> That was great. This is awesome.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kurt: </strong> Are you ready to go on the <strong>rollercoaster</strong>?</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> I’m ready.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Kurt: </strong> Here we go!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> That’s awesome.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> That was...That was awesome! I just want to go one more time. I promise. That’s it. Just one more time.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> This course is <strong>bumpy </strong>and <strong>uneven</strong>. <u>I was told that I could drive this course.</u> So I am.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> <em>(to Rick)</em> Okay, Rick, are you <strong>rolling</strong>? Awesome. Okay, this course is uneven. But I think the ride will be smooth.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> Ooh. This hill is really <strong>steep</strong>.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> Oh my gosh. I can’t tell you how much fun this is.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> Penelope, that was so much fun! I think I need to go again.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong> Uh, Anna, I think we have enough test drive video.</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Anna: </strong> <u>Ms. Weaver said to get a lot.</u> So, I think I should go again. <em>(to Rick)</em> Rick, I’m going to go again. Until next time!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Penelope: </strong> But I want to get lunch, Anna!</p>
                        <p class = "VOAsmaller"><strong>Professor Bot: </strong> <u>Penelope said she wants to go to lunch</u>. But I don’t think that’s going to happen soon. Visit our website for more!</p>
